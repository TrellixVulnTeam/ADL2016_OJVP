He also wished to know whether there had been any court decisions in cases relating directly to the victims of violations of economic, social and cultural rights.
Moreover, he enquired whether there had been any court rulings on corruption cases since the adoption of the anti-corruption act in March 2005.
Mr. Dasgupta asked why pygmy communities were reportedly subject to discriminatory bureaucratic procedures, including differential access to identity documents and consequently to education and health care, in violation of article 12 of the national Constitution.
He also asked the delegation to provide further details with regard to the administrative instructions on eliminating discriminatory practices against pygmy communities.
The discriminatory provisions contained in articles 444 and 448 of the Family Code clearly violated the principle of the equal rights of men and women.
Mr. Kerdoun said that Congolese society needed to be stabilized before economic, social and cultural rights could be realized.
The Democratic Republic of the Congo was vast, with immense natural wealth.
However, 30 years of social disruption caused by external aggression and dictatorship had had a dramatic effect on the country, including the economy.
In that regard, education was of particular interest.
He asked whether the State party would be prepared to take immediate measures to repeal legislation that discriminated against women; such action would require no funding and could be undertaken very quickly.
She asked what specific measures had been taken in accordance with the national Constitution to eliminate discrimination against women, in particular to repeal discriminatory laws.
She requested further information on reports that human rights defenders in the State party were facing difficulties because they often exposed the illegal activities of mining companies.
Ms. Bonoan-Dandan requested further details with respect to the State party's reply to question 7 of the list of issues on reducing deforestation and protecting the economic, social and cultural rights of forest dwellers.
She asked for details of mechanisms in place to ensure adherence to the Forest Code and of specific plans for reforestation and cooperation with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in that respect.
Ms. Barahona Riera asked what authority the Ministry for Human Rights possessed to ensure effective realization of human rights through domestic legislation, and what resources were available to that end.
The meeting was suspended at 11.30 a.m. and resumed at 11.55 a.m.
That situation was the result of 30 years of dictatorship, which had plunged the country into a cycle of debt.
It was hoped that agreements stemming from those discussions would enable the Congolese people to benefit from their natural wealth.
While those measures to secure the economic, social and cultural rights of the Congolese people were positive steps, they would take time to come to fruition.
Although it was sometimes alleged by external observers that the State was violating its own laws, that was not the case.
The Government had a core responsibility for promoting and protecting all human rights, but could only do so within the bounds of its financial resources.
Since the first free elections in 2001 and 2006, efforts had been made to build democracy and the rule of law, and permit national reconstruction in the wake of 30 years of dictatorship.
Turning to judicial matters, he said that justice was an integral part of the establishment of democracy and the rule of law.
The justice system was being developed with international support.
Separation of powers was guaranteed under the Constitution, and the judiciary was therefore independent.
The legal system was based on the Belgian and French systems, and had been adapted to the specific situation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The Judicial Service Commission was responsible for overseeing the functioning of the judiciary and providing adequate training for judges, a fundamental part of which involved ensuring that adequate focus was placed on human rights.
There was also a shortage of judges as a result of the zero-tolerance policy on corruption and impunity, under which a considerable number of judges had been dismissed.
A programme had been launched for the construction of courts in 147 provinces and territories, some of which had already been completed.
It also provided for the building of new prisons, and ensured training for judges.
An awareness-raising campaign was under way to inform the public of their rights regarding access to the judiciary.
A five-pillar development programme was being implemented, which required considerable financial resources.
A debt relief programme under the HIPC Initiative would be implemented in the first quarter of 2010, in an effort to alleviate the $10 billion debt burden that had been accumulated during the dictatorship.
The relief of that debt would enable resources to be directed to address the needs of the population.
Appropriate amendments to the Code were currently before Parliament for adoption, but had been subject to delays.
He called on NGOs to put pressure on Parliament to adopt those amendments promptly.
A draft law on the establishment of a new national human rights institution was also before Parliament, but was unlikely to be adopted during the current parliamentary session owing to budgetary constraints.
On the issue of combating corruption, he said that his delegation intended to provide the Committee with examples of relevant court decisions.
Concerning forestry, measures to reduce deforestation included conducting a review of all existing contracts and extending only those that were in conformity with the provisions of the Forest Code.
As a result, there had been a reduction in forested areas cleared for occupation, which had contributed to deforestation in the past.
In addition, a national reforestation programme had been launched with the assistance of the World Bank and other donor organizations.
A monitoring mechanism was in place to ensure that the needs of the local inhabitants were met and that companies did not violate their rights.
As for the Bambouti pygmies, he said that the situation was improving and they were beginning to have access to education and training and to employment in professions such as teaching and the police force.
The full force of the law was used to reduce discrimination against pygmies, including prosecuting law enforcement officials who violated the rights of indigenous people.
He assured the Committee that cases of human rights defenders facing harassment, reprisals and infringements of their rights when they denounced violations of economic or social rights were extremely rare.
However, he questioned whether all human rights defenders acted with probity in accordance with their recognized status.
When NGOs made allegations that crimes had been committed, those were taken seriously by the justice system and legal proceedings were set in motion.
The Government had a duty to ensure that the right to a fair trial was guaranteed in all cases.
Despite its limited resources, it played an important role in following up legal reforms, especially with regard to women's and children's rights.
It also acted as a neutral, independent mediator to facilitate dialogue between all human rights actors and to resolve sensitive problems.
He confirmed that the new National Commission for Human Rights would be an independent, consultative body to support and supplement the activities of the Government on the promotion and protection of human rights.
He said that the delegation would provide fuller, written answers to the list of issues contained in document E/C.12/COD/Q/5 in due course.
There were special measures in place to protect particularly vulnerable groups in general, but limited budgetary resources made it difficult to allocate substantial funds to a particular sector.
However, steady economic growth meant that more resources should be available in the future for the protection of economic, social and cultural rights.
It was therefore hoped that indicators in the next report would be more positive.
Mr. Mutomb Mujing (Democratic Republic of the Congo), responding to Mr. Kerdoun's concerns about the state of the national economy, said that the country had reached a crossroads.
Its 40-year history of political instability and conflict had led to the current paradoxical situation of needing to prevent conflict while at the same time carrying out national reconstruction.
Such a difficult challenge could only be overcome by ensuring good governance, consolidating peace and reducing vulnerability, strengthening economic growth and capacity-building, providing for basic social needs and coordinating external aid.
However, companies contracted by the Government could make useful contributions to the State.
Ms. Bras Gomes asked when the discriminatory provisions concerning women contained in the Family Code would be repealed.
Ms. Bonoan-Dandan expressed concern that some of her questions had not been answered, especially with regard to deforestation and the protection of local communities.
She urged the delegation to reply fully to questions orally at the current session rather than responding in writing later, which would make the Committee's task of preparing concluding observations more difficult.
Pressure on Parliament to pass those bills should come from the Government and not, as the delegation had suggested, from NGOs.
Commission on the Status of Women
1-12 March 2010
Item 3 (a) of the provisional agenda*
The Secretary-General has received the following statement, which is being circulated in accordance with paragraphs 36 and 37 of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/31.
Statement
We work in grass-roots gender empowerment activities and specifically in service provision and advocacy for women and girls who are prostituted and trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation.
In her report, the Special Rapporteur also highlights the hidden aspect of unreported and undocumented within-country trafficking, and the vulnerability of 1.2 million children.
Trafficking generates massive profits for traffickers and massive human rights violations.
While this Convention and its Protocol have created awareness of the enormity of the issue and led to initiatives to organize a unified global response, a comprehensive approach to trafficking is still lacking.
Unless the United Nations, Governments and civil society address the tremendous role of the global sex industry in creating the demand for sex trafficking, trafficking in girls and women will continue to flourish.
The Human Rights Council extended this mandate in 2008.
Good practices and areas of concern are identified through the individual complaints procedure, country visits and the annual report of the Council.
Issues to be addressed
In paragraph 113 (b), trafficking in women and forced prostitution are mentioned.
These practices are contrary to the human rights and fundamental freedoms of each and every girl and woman.
Prostitution is never a real choice made in freedom.
All prostitution denies and violates the inalienable, integral and indivisible part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of girls and women.
The situation is further blurred when labour laws regulate prostitution and call it “sex work”, as this implies that if working conditions are in conformity with labour standards, then prostitution is acceptable.
Prostitution is never acceptable; it demeans and dehumanizes the person and human sexuality.
Legalization of prostitution exacerbates the widespread sexual abuse of girls and women by increasing demand for prostituted girls and women and thereby fuelling sex trafficking.
Two significant underlying causes of trafficking in women and girls persist: gender inequality and demand.
The attitude and acceptance of male privilege generates a culture of demand, which must be confronted.
Demand for trafficking in girls and women and the greed of those who profit from the exploitation of all forms of enslavement must be denounced.
Recommendations to Member States
Strategic Objective D.3 of the Beijing Platform for Action reads “Eliminate trafficking in women and assist victims of violence due to prostitution and trafficking”.
The strategies embedded in the Beijing Platform for Action still have not been implemented.
Therefore, we urge Governments, intergovernmental organizations and civil society to:
• Implement coherent human rights-based national policies that explicitly denounce prostitution and its legalization as a violation of women's human rights.
• Adopt a model of trafficking legislation, following Sweden's example, that addresses demand by criminalizing traffickers and purchasers and by decriminalizing women and girls exploited by market forces of supply and demand.
• Strengthen community educational programmes that address gender inequality, male privilege and the culture of demand that perpetuates trafficking in girls and women.
Develop widespread public awareness campaigns of zero tolerance for all forms of exploitation.
• Address poverty, unemployment and gender inequality by linking anti-trafficking and anti-prostitution initiatives with the Millennium Development Goals.
Ensure the adoption of labour policies that promote decent work and protect against exploitation.
• Resource and improve protective measures for victims of trafficking, regardless of whether or not they are participating in criminal justice proceedings.
• Enact and enforce legislation to combat all forms of violence against women.
Beijing Platform for Action, para.
Third session
New York, 4-15 May 2009
Working paper submitted by Sweden on behalf of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden as members of the New Agenda Coalition
Background
(d) Security assurances;
(g) Testing of nuclear weapons.
Building upon the elements developed in those papers, the New Agenda Coalition would like to offer additional reflections and substantive recommendations on ways forward for nuclear disarmament work during the current review cycle.
These additional elements do not affect the status of NPT/CONF.2010/PC.1/WP.15 and NPT/CONF.2010/PC.II/WP.26, which remain current.
Reductions in nuclear forces
The Coalition strongly encourages the conclusion of a new treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation in 2009, since the START Treaty is due to expire on 5 December 2009.
Such a treaty should include all nuclear weapons, both strategic and non-strategic.
The New Agenda Coalition underlines that other nuclear-weapon States must also reduce their nuclear arsenals, and recognizes recent announcements of such reductions.
Continuous and irreversible progress on nuclear arms reductions would also strengthen non-proliferation efforts.
Significant progress in the implementation of article VI commitments is urgently required to bring the world closer to fulfilling the commitment to the complete elimination of existing nuclear weapons and the objective of a nuclear-weapon-free world.
Prohibition on the testing of nuclear weapons
The entry into force of the Treaty would also strengthen confidence in the international security system through the establishment of an effective verification mechanism.
While awaiting the entry into force of the Treaty, it is of utmost importance that moratoriums on nuclear weapon test explosions, and all other nuclear explosions, be maintained.
However, moratoriums do not have the same permanent and legally binding effect as an effectively verifiable treaty.
States parties need to take concrete steps to ensure the full implementation of these commitments and obligations.
Review Conferences should address specifically what might be done to strengthen the implementation of the Treaty and achieve its universality”.
V. Nuclear-weapon-free zones
The New Agenda Coalition continues to support the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones.
The New Agenda Coalition welcomes the entry into force on 21 March 2009 of the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia.
This is the first nuclear-weapon-free zone to be established entirely in the northern hemisphere and it will also encompass an area where nuclear weapons previously existed.
The New Agenda Coalition also welcomes the stated intention of all concerned States to address any outstanding issues that may affect the operation of the Treaty.
The entry into force of the Treaty underlines the value of nuclear-weapon-free zones and is an important step towards achieving the objectives of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
The First Conference of States Parties and signatories to Treaties that establish nuclear-weapon-free zones was held in 2005.
The New Agenda Coalition will continue to encourage greater cooperation and consultation mechanisms through the establishment of concrete measures among the existing nuclear-weapon-free zones in order to contribute to the implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty regime.
The New Agenda Coalition therefore supports efforts to convene a second nuclear-weapon-free zone conference, as a contribution to the 2010 Review Conference.
SUMMARY RECORD OF THE 1375th MEETING
Held at the Palais Wilson, Geneva,
on Wednesday, 14 January 2009, at 3 p.m.
CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS OF STATES PARTIES (continued)
Second periodic report of Chad (continued)
The meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.
CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS OF STATES PARTIES (agenda item 4) (continued)
Second periodic report of Chad (CRC/C/TCD/2, CRC/C/TCD/Q/2 and Add.1) (continued)
At the invitation of the Chairperson, the members of the delegation of Chad resumed their places at the Committee table.
Mr. FILALI said that, while the report referred to the establishment of special children's divisions in the courts of first instance, it did not describe any specific court procedures for appeals thereafter.
While in theory children could be held for up to 10 hours in police custody, the Committee had received reports according to which they were sometimes detained much longer.
It was well known that the overwhelming majority of abuses took place during periods of police custody and pretrial detention.
Did the Government have any means to ensure compliance with the prescribed time limit?
Was it possible for judges to intervene if the limit was exceeded?
The imposition on minors, even in extremely serious criminal cases, of prison sentences of 10 years was excessive, as it went well beyond the time required for the social reintegration of a child.
Lastly, he asked whether any studies had been carried out to determine ways of dealing with the overcrowding in the country's prisons, which had reportedly led to problems related to violence.
Were there sufficient budgetary resources to ensure proper conditions of detention?
The delegation should also describe the efforts made by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and others to promote responsible fatherhood.
The situation of child livestock-herders (enfants bouviers) was of concern to the Committee.
Who checked on their living conditions or their relations with their families, and verified that they were not subjected to sexual or labour exploitation?
While reportedly a bill had been drawn up to address the problem, its adoption could take time, and the delegation should describe what administrative steps could be taken in the interim.
Specifically, had Chad ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption?
Ms. SMITH said that the Committee had received reports that sexual abuse of girls was common, and that little was done by the Government to prevent rape or protect children from such abuse.
The problem was particularly acute near refugee camps, and such crimes were seldom investigated.
In the rare cases where compensation was awarded, it was sometimes given not to the girl victims themselves, but to their village chiefs.
What was the Government doing to protect such girls and to prosecute offenders?
The problem of child labour, in particular the hiring of refugee children and the use of children as herders and domestic workers, was of concern.
Did the Government have any plans for the prosecution of people involved in child exploitation, including the sale of children for work as herders?
Lastly, the delegation should inform the Committee what costs were incurred for health services for children, and more specifically for adolescents.
The CHAIRPERSON said that the Committee had received reports that children in refugee camps had been recruited into the Chadian army, and that there was also a high level of gender-based violence in the refugee camps.
What efforts had the Government made to address those problems?
Ms. NGARBATINA (Chad) said that the Chadian army did not recruit children, and that the Government did everything in its power to ensure that children did not join the military.
The Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Social Action and the Family both checked at army barracks to ensure that no children were enrolled; if any were found, they were immediately removed.
Mr. MADNANGAR (Chad) said that in the Government ministry dealing with human rights issues, there was a directorate for vulnerable persons, which generally meant women and children.
Judges were given training in the rights of the child at various levels, in the form of seminars and workshops, some of which also admitted members of the police.
The most recent training events had been held in 2006, for 39 judges, and in 2007, for 50 participants.
The draft code on the protection of children too incorporated the concept of the best interests of the child.
While the Criminal Code made no reference to torture, the Constitution spoke of the inviolability of the human person and the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment.
In legal practice, torture was treated as assault and battery or serious wounding, which was punishable under the Criminal Code.
Police officers accused of torturing children in police custody were automatically prosecuted.
The new law reorganizing the judiciary called for children's divisions to be established in all national courts.
Mr. FILALI said that from the perspective of criminal law, torture was not the same thing as assault and battery or serious wounding.
The former was classified as a serious offence or felony (crime), and the latter as an ordinary offence or misdemeanour (délit).
It would be advisable for the State party to adopt a specific law against torture in order to ensure that the appropriate penalties were imposed.
A joint plan of action had been adopted as well, which had made it possible to establish local protection centres.
Six of those centres had been set up in Chad with support from the United States embassy and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and had begun reporting cases of child trafficking.
In 2008 a national plan of action had been drawn up to combat child trafficking, and another was being drafted for 2009 in the Ministry of Social Action and the Family.
As for the definition of the child, Chad had ratified the Convention and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the African Child.
At the national level the definition of the child was the same as in those two instruments.
That resulted for example in teenage pregnancies, and thus restricted the enjoyment by girls of their rights as children.
The Government should amend the bill to bring it into line with the Committee's recommendations, so that the minimum age would be 18 for both.
According to information provided by the delegation, over 60 per cent of girls currently married before reaching the age of 16.
The Government was making efforts to raise awareness among community and religious leaders of the importance of the rights of the child.
Ms. NGARBATINA (Chad) said that the adoption of the Family Code would resolve many problems, and that the Government was continuing to collect information in order to produce the best draft possible.
As part of those efforts, it was sending a mission to Senegal and Tunisia to learn from the experiences of other countries.
Mr. MADNANGAR (Chad) said that the Convention and other international instruments adopted by the Government were a part of domestic law, and ensured that the political rights of children were protected.
Under the Criminal Code, abandonment of children was a punishable offence.
The poverty reduction strategy called for the establishment of a national fund against poverty, which would address inter alia the situation of street children.
Ms. ORTIZ asked for more information on the six local protection centres that had been set up in Chad, and on what kind of cases they handled.
Mr. CITARELLA asked about the legal status of unregistered children.
In practical terms, what rights did they have, such as access to education and health services?
Mr. DJONGA (Chad) said that since birth registration and the issuing of birth certificates had become free of charge in 2006, more births were being registered than a few years ago.
Studies had shown that a lack of means to pay for birth registration had prevented parents from registering their children in the past.
That situation had changed.
When a child's birth was registered, he or she was legally born; until that point he or she did not legally exist.
When a child obtained legal status, he or she was included in the population census and could benefit from all the rights to which Chadians were entitled.
Mr. KOTRANE (Alternate Country Rapporteur) said that the majority of births were still not registered and asked whether that meant that those children did not exist and had no rights or legal status.
Mr. DJONGA (Chad) said that it was not that those children did not exist, but if they were not registered then they did not exist in legal terms.
A campaign was under way to encourage the registration of older children as well.
Mr. HINFIENNE (Chad) said that the issue of Sudanese children was a specific problem.
Under Chadian law, any child born in Chad had Chadian nationality; however, because of the strained relations between Chad and Sudan, Sudanese children born in Chad were not registered.
Mr. DJONGA (Chad) said that under Chadian law, special provisions were made for children in court.
Under the current structure, children's divisions were available in all courts, presided over by a children's judge.
The special provisions were applicable at the appeal stage right through to the Supreme Court.
Prosecutors could make regular inspections of police stations, even three times a day, if necessary, to ensure that children were not detained arbitrarily.
The maximum sentence for children for a criminal offence was 10 years.
The Government would consider how it could adapt its legislation to bring it into line with international law.
The draft code on the protection of children contained proposals in that regard.
Under Chadian law, minors had to be detained separately from adults.
In a trial involving both adults and children, the latter would automatically be handed over to a children's judge.
Mr. FILALI pointed out that, according to paragraph 259 of the report, minors were not separated from adults in detention.
Torture was not a question of categorizing bodily harm as either simple or aggravated assault; it was a clearly defined concept.
Mr. ZERMATTEN (Country Rapporteur) said that, in reality, there was no separation of minors and adults in detention, partly on account of prison overcrowding.
He asked what the Government planned to do to ensure that the law was enforced.
Ms. NGARBATINA (Chad) said that the Government was aware of the situation of overcrowding in its prisons as a result of which children and adults were imprisoned together.
Provisions had been made in the 2009 budget to begin separating the two groups.
It was a serious issue because a child imprisoned with hardened criminals had no chance of rehabilitation.
The Government was committed to tackling the issue and was not ashamed to discuss it.
To combat rape and harassment in refugee camps, police had received specific training and had been posted to the camps to guarantee security.
Refugees had confirmed that the situation had improved.
The Government was doing everything in its power to protect vulnerable groups, such as refugees, and to punish the perpetrators.
The system for setting up the committees contained various safeguards.
In both the capital and in the provinces, they were composed of a range of members of society, including magistrates, social workers, police chiefs, civil society, and religious leaders.
Mr. DJIDINGAR (Chad) said that the right to education in Chad was enshrined in the Constitution.
The Government had declared education a national priority as part of the poverty reduction strategy.
Since the Millennium Development Goals had been established in 2000, the Government had undertaken reforms to ensure that all children had access to education by 2015.
Progress had been made in terms of the percentage of children attending school, although there was still a disparity between the percentages of boys and girls.
The education policy focused on children who were typically excluded from education, such as children from rural areas and girls.
Many of the teachers in the Chadian education system were community elders.
During the 1970s, many communities had created their own schools and recruited teachers to make up for the national shortfall.
Communities had become a vital partner to the Government in education as they provided the training and pay for many teachers, and maintained school premises in rural areas.
The school coverage problem was linked to the mobilization of resources.
Every year the Government launched a programme for 2,000 new classrooms funded by its oil revenues.
The drop in the oil price and the slowdown in the amount of development aid over recent years had negative implications for the school coverage programme in terms of the availability of classrooms and the recruitment of teachers.
Non-attendance at school was still a problem, particularly among girls.
Ambitious actions plans were being drawn up with the support of partners, including UNICEF, to encourage parents to send their children, especially girls, to school.
The CHAIRPERSON said that if money from oil revenues had been added to the education budget, it would suggest that the budget had increased.
However, it had been noted by the Committee that the overall budget for education and health had decreased.
It had been further noted that the social sector received the smallest budget allocation.
Mr. ZERMATTEN (Country Rapporteur) said that education had been declared a priority under the Chadian poverty reduction strategy and oil revenues would help to achieve that goal.
Mr. KRAPPMANN said that combining the poverty reduction strategy with education was a good approach.
He asked what happened to the many children who left school before graduation, or even before finishing primary school, and whether any programmes were available to give them a second chance.
Mr. KOTRANE (Alternate Country Rapporteur) said that, according to the information available, most of the children concerned worked from a very early age.
Chadian law prohibited child labour in line with international law, but in practice many children worked.
He asked what the Government's strategy was in that regard and what results it had obtained.
He asked whether Chad had joined the International Labour Organization's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC).
Alternative opportunities, such as training, should be available.
Mr. DJIDINGAR (Chad) said that the education budget had not been cut.
As a proportion of GDP or percentage of the State budget, it was less significant, but compared to before the receipt of oil revenues, it had doubled.
In terms of Central African CFA francs the amount allocated to the social budget had more than doubled.
Mr. SIDDIQUI said that it was the percentage of the total budget allocated that was important, especially since Chad had recently gained access to oil revenues.
If a lot of money went to the defence budget, instead of the social budget, then people would remain in poverty and the country's problems would persist.
Mr. DJIDINGAR (Chad) said that the proportion of the budget in real terms was another matter.
He was speaking of the allocation of resources to the education sector, which had increased from year to year but was nevertheless insufficient.
The Government was confronted with a decrease in foreign assistance from, among others, the World Bank and the European Union.
Unfortunately, the programme had never received funding.
There were, however, preschools at the kindergarten level.
In Chad, schooling was free of charge.
About 41 per cent of children completed primary school; the other 59 per cent dropped out essentially for reasons of poverty.
In addition, many girls left school because of early marriages.
Another challenge was adapting school programmes to the cultural needs of the population.
The school system was a vestige of the French colonial presence, and not ideally suited to Chadian conditions.
The Government had created a national curriculum, to be introduced for the first time in 2009, and would be publishing school manuals for primary school in both Arabic and French, which was unprecedented.
A key principle of education policy was adapting the content of the curriculum to the realities of life in Chad, in particular to ensure that families accepted the schooling offered.
The Government had also created an informal educational programme designed to help children who had dropped out of school, by offering them vocational training.
Fifteen centres had already been established, and there were plans for 47 more, with funds from the Islamic Development Bank and the African Development Bank.
Those were small education units, which would teach young people a trade.
A Ministry of Microcredit had also been created, offering credit to young men and women to help them create income-generating activities and emerge from poverty.
There were also programmes to combat child labour, in particular to rescue the enfants bouviers and return them to school.
It was true that not many children had been retrieved so far, but the political will and institutional framework to do so existed.
The meeting was suspended at 4.40 p.m. and resumed at 4.50 p.m.
Ms. NGARBATINA (Chad) said that the Government's position vis-à-vis children with disabilities was clear: it sought to reintegrate such children into normal life.
There had traditionally been a taboo against persons with disabilities; that taboo was gradually disappearing as a result of efforts by the Government and others.
In fact, private citizens had brought the problem to the attention of the Government.
Traditionally, a disability was viewed as shameful, but families could turn to the Ministry of Social Action and the Family for assistance.
Partners were assisting Chad in combating poverty.
In addition, a survey had been undertaken to determine why young girls were resorting to prostitution, and efforts were being made to protect such girls from the dangers of the street.
Ms. ORTIZ asked whether there were local programmes to teach families and communities, particularly in rural areas, how to prevent young girls from turning to prostitution.
Ms. NGARBATINA (Chad) said that the Ministry of Social Action and the Family had a high degree of visibility owing to the many crises to which it had responded.
Individuals made requests to the Ministry for assistance, which was provided as urgently as possible.
There were cases, for example, in which divorced mothers could not feed their children - a matter of survival.
Efforts were made to pair outstanding students from poor environments with sponsors.
For instance, each of the members of the delegation had young people to whom they gave personal support.
Funds had been gathered to create a structure for the reintegration of street children, and the Ministry had assisted by providing trained staff.
As for young girls who did not wish to attend school, the Ministry of Social Action and the Family directed them to the Ministry of Microcredit to help them set up their own businesses.
Chadian women were very active in women's organizations, and many women's lives had been changed as a result.
The Ministry sought to identify families needing assistance, and to help them to emerge from poverty in a sustainable way.
That was not an easy process, and Chad was seeking partners that could help.
Many other countries of the world had managed to recover from poverty; there was no reason why Chad could not do the same.
Ms. RAHAMA SALEH (Chad) said that the rate of child mortality in Chad was high, and had not improved in 10 years.
In addition, access to health services remained a problem for many Chadians.
There were not enough clinics and insufficient access to existing ones.
The Ministry of Public Health, with the assistance of development partners, had developed a new national health policy for 2007-2015, and a budget was being developed.
In 2002, an accelerated health development strategy had been created with the support of UNICEF, which aimed to reduce child mortality by mobilizing all health sectors, including communities.
The Strategy for Promoting Children's Survival and Development comprised three components, vaccination, immunization, and integrated treatment of childhood illnesses, and had been tested from 2002-2005 in three health districts of Chad.
An external evaluation had shown that the strategy reduced the child mortality rate by nearly 10 percentage points.
The Ministry was currently seeking to implement that strategy nationwide.
Turning to questions raised about HIV/AIDS, she said that programmes to prevent the transmission of illnesses from mothers to children were admittedly weak.
A national coordination system had been created in 2006, and since 2007, antiretroviral drugs and other essential medicines had been available free of charge.
Development partners had shown a commitment and willingness to help, and four national experts had been recruited to assist in the campaign against HIV/AIDS in the districts most severely affected.
Initiatives designed to care for the country's 6,000 orphans provided treatment free of charge, along with health care and education.
The Ministry of Social Action and the Family also gave support to families supporting orphans suffering from HIV/AIDS for the development of income-generating activities.
Such orphans had been designated a national priority for 2009.
Chad had not attended major international conferences on female genital mutilation although the costs of participation were covered.
Ms. NGARBATINA (Chad) said that working against female genital mutilation was no longer taboo in Chad.
The Government had linked the campaign against female genital mutilation with HIV/AIDS and the campaign against fistula.
Many women had fistula as a result of bearing children too young and of inadequate health care, and were often rejected as a result.
Women treated for fistula were given a sum of money by UNFPA on leaving the hospital; many had received training and had taken up work with hospitals in N'Djamena.
In her view, that was an important beginning.
At the behest of other countries, Chad had begun to develop a campaign against HIV/AIDS.
Many national associations had become involved, including the Network of African Women Ministers and Members of Parliament, with funds provided by the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
Ever since the drugs had become available free, people were willing to be screened for the illness.
It was her great hope that people would eventually refer to HIV/AIDS as they currently did to malaria.
The regions of Kanem and Bahr el Gazal suffered from chronic structural agricultural deficits, and many men departed, leaving behind women and children without resources to meet their needs.
The weight of tradition, and ignorance of basic nutritional habits, such as exclusive breastfeeding or dietary supplements for children, had aggravated the situation.
An action plan with a focus on nutritional health and food security had been set up to address malnutrition in those regions.
The CHAIRPERSON noted that there had been a question on whether the national Human Rights Commission was independent.
Ms. NGARBATINA (Chad) said she was convinced that the Human Rights Commission was indeed independent.
Mr. PARFITT asked whether the Human Rights Commission had a children's focus and whether any of its members were responsible for examining cases of abuse of children's rights.
It would also be interesting to know whether it had an investigative capacity and whether it reported on its findings to the public at large.
The Committee had received reports that some of Chad's human rights defenders had been harassed and even abused by the police.
He asked the delegation to comment on those allegations.
The national conference which had set up the Commission had stipulated that it was to be independent.
The Commission was composed exclusively of representatives of civil society.
When a human rights violation came to its attention, its representatives investigated on site and submitted proposals for action to the Government, which did not interfere in its work in any way.
The CHAIRPERSON asked whether Chad was planning to ratify the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.
Mr. MADNANGAR (Chad) said that the Government was on the verge of ratifying the Hague Convention.
All that remained was for the National Assembly to take a decision on it.
Given the unpleasant memories associated with the Zoe's Arc case, efforts were being made to speed up the ratification process.
Mr. ZERMATTEN (Country Rapporteur) said that that was precisely the reply that the delegation had given the Committee nine years previously during the introduction of the initial country report.
Ms. KHATTAB asked whether there were different laws applicable to Muslims and non-Muslims, given that Muslims did not recognize adoption.
Ms. NGARBATINA (Chad) said that Chad was a secular State, and the same law was applicable to all.
She assured the Committee that the Government had every intention of moving forward swiftly with the ratification of the Hague Convention; there must be no recurrence of the events associated with Zoe's Arc.
Ms. ORTIZ asked whether, pending ratification of the Hague Convention, new legislation or administrative measures on adoption were planned in line with article 21 of that instrument.
For example, a central adoption authority could be established as a reference framework, even though it was not approved by the parliament.
After all, the matter needed to be addressed as a matter of urgency.
It would be useful to know whether Chad already had a central authority responsible for domestic adoptions and, if so, whether it looked after the rights of children in their adoptive families.
Awareness-raising had a role to play in that regard.
Furthermore, bilateral agreements could be concluded with countries with which Chad had close relations so that it could properly monitor the adoption process.
All those measures could be taken even before the Hague Convention was ratified.
She also sought more information on the enfants bouviers.
Ms. NGARBATINA (Chad), referring to domestic adoptions, pointed out that a legal framework was already in place in that respect.
The question of enfants bouviers, a practice whereby the children of indigent parents were sold to work as cattle herders, was a matter of deep concern.
A number of human rights associations and representatives of civil society were cooperating with the Government to address the problem, which was close to being resolved.
A reintegration centre had been set up for such children, many of whom had returned to school or were receiving vocational training.
The practice of enfants bouviers subjected children to terrible abuse and was completely unacceptable.
Ms. AIDOO asked whether Chad's poverty reduction strategy gave priority attention to such children and their families.
Mr. DJIDINGAR (Chad) said that the Government had proposed the establishment of a national fund to combat indigence in Chad.
The fund was to receive 1 per cent of the country's revenues from oil exports.
The relevant legislative text was in preparation.
In the meantime, the State secretariat set up to promote microfinancing and combat poverty mobilized 3 billion CFA francs yearly for its initiatives.
Mr. BLAGUE (Chad) said that the Koundoul children's centre currently housed only 60 street children and other indigent children, whereas previously it had been able to accommodate 400.
The centre had been destroyed in a fire, and it had been rebuilt in the 1990s.
With French assistance, further buildings had been added to increase the centre's capacity.
Unfortunately, children who had been involved with the armed forces and armed groups and had been placed in the centre had wrecked the buildings, leaving only one wing undamaged.
The Government was in the process of repairing the facilities so as to be able to lodge other street children there.
It was planned to build another centre with a capacity for at least 500 children annually.
It was to be hoped that eventually the country's seven biggest cities would all have their own centres.
In that context, the Committee welcomed the poverty reduction strategy and the establishment of a secretariat to promote microfinancing, and it was pleased that a national fund to combat indigence was planned.
The resources that had become available from oil export revenues were a positive development, but the Committee was concerned that the Ministry of Social Action and the Family was not receiving sufficient funding.
A greater percentage of the budget must also be earmarked for education and health care, and it was important to ensure financial support for indigent families.
With regard to general measures of implementation of the Convention, the question of coordination had been discussed at length, and the Committee hoped that an inter-ministerial body would be set up as soon as possible.
It was of the utmost importance for all armed forces and armed groups to stop recruiting children and to see to it that children who had been enlisted were demobilized and reintegrated in society.
All children needed to have a real legal existence, and to that end, it was essential to bring about a noticeable improvement in the system of birth registration.
The Government must also protect children from economic and sexual exploitation and put an end to violence in school.
It must promote the rights of the child by training professionals active in the area, raising public awareness, teaching children about their rights and making provision for independent monitoring of their implementation.
The Committee was pleased that the Government intended to promote the rule of law, put an end to impunity and introduce a judicial system, but stressed that the judiciary must be independent and effective.
To promote children's rights, Chad must ratify and implement the relevant international instruments, including the Hague Convention.
The Committee looked forward to receiving further information in Chad's written replies.
Ms. NGARBATINA (Chad) thanked the Committee for the constructive dialogue.
The delegation had taken due note of the Committee's comments and looked forward to its concluding observations.
The meeting rose at 6.00 p.m.
This record is subject to correction.
Corrections should be submitted in one of the working languages.
Any corrections to the records of the public meetings of the Committee at this session will be consolidated in a single corrigendum, to be issued shortly after the end of the session.

Ethiopia is a multi-ethnic country, where diverse societies, cultures and languages co-exist.
Despite this reality, accommodating diversity and protecting the rights of the different ethnic groups has been a daunting challenge for the country throughout its history.
Both under the monarchies for hundreds of years and the military regime for over a decade and half, the country could not address the challenges of diversity.
The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination has been made part of the country's body of laws for more than three decades now.
Significant political and social changes have taken place since the State made its initial report under the Convention.
The report also addresses the concerns the Committee expressed in its concluding observations.
Despite the Government's commitment to report under the Convention and engage in constructive dialogue with the Committee, the State party's reports were overdue.
That was an unfortunate situation, which understandably led the Committee to issue concluding observations without the benefit of the State party's reports and dialogue with its representatives.
The Government regrets this situation and would like to assure the Committee and others of its commitment to the protection of human rights in general and the elimination of racial discrimination in particular.
The Government would like to inform the Committee and all concerned that the reasons for the delay of the reports rested on constellation of factors which technical limitations were the major ones.
These difficulties have now been resolved with the technical assistance of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights East Africa Regional Office (OHCHR).
The State would also like to express its satisfaction in making this report and hope for constructive dialogue with the Committee.
Article 1
The foundation of the State's constitutional system is equality among nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia.
As such the diversity of nations, nationalities and peoples is the hallmark of the fabrics of the State.
The domestic legal regime for the elimination of racial discrimination heavily draws on the fundamental constitutional principle of the right to equality.
The definition of “racial discrimination” envisaged in the Convention has been incorporated into the Ethiopian legal system through the supreme law of the land, the FDRE Constitution, and other legislation.
Prohibition of discrimination based on social origin is so comprehensive as to include prohibition of discrimination based on descent.
All constitutions of the regional states also prohibit any form of discrimination on the basis of race, nation, nationality or other social origin and colour.
The Federal Constitution prohibits any form of discrimination.
As a result, the scope of prohibition of racial discrimination encompasses direct or indirect forms of discrimination.
To deal with indirect forms of racial discrimination, the Constitution has given an assurance that acts that seem non-discriminatory will be prohibited if they are proven to be discriminatory in anyway.
The prohibition of racial discrimination is the corner stone of the democratic system in Ethiopia.
The Constitution prohibits its derogation during a state of emergency as well.
The non-existence of racial discrimination in measures taken during a state of emergency is legally ensured in conformity with the obligations laid down under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Ethnicity in the Ethiopian legal system is conceived from the notion of nation, nationality or people.
An individual's ethnicity is recognized on the self-identification of such person or his/her origin of birth.
A person is entitled to identify himself as having mixed ethnicity or even not to identify himself as belonging to a particular ethnic group and identify himself as an Ethiopian.
For example, the population census accommodates persons of various ethnic origins such persons as those with mixed ethnicity and people who do not wish to state their ethnicity.
Minority groups are recognized under the Constitution and seats in the parliament are allotted to them.
However, a complete list of the minority groups in the country has not yet been provided.
More recently, due to natural calamities such as flooding and drought in some parts of the country, many people have been displaced from their homes.
The internal displacement of people due to the conflict between the Agnuak and the Nuer peoples in 2003 and 2004 is one such instance.
Internal displacements also occur occasionally due to conflicts over grazing lands between pastoralist communities.
Foreigners enjoy most of the rights and privileges that Ethiopian nationals do.
They are entitled to the fundamental civil, economic and social rights provided in the Constitution and other human rights instruments.
Exceptions include the right to vote and the right to be elected, which are exercised by Ethiopians only.
The enjoyment of some social, economic and administrative services by foreigners may also be subject to conditions.
Under immigration law, foreign nationals are required to possess valid travel documents, visa or permanent resident permits issued by the appropriate authority.
Internationally valid health certificates may be necessary (depending on the country of origin) and other documents as specified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to enter the country.
All foreigners residing in Ethiopia must be registered by the Immigration and Nationality Main Department.
Some foreigners including diplomats and international civil servants and members of their families residing in Ethiopia or a foreigner who is recognized as a refugee by the Government of Ethiopia and UNHCR are not required to be registered.
A foreigner who is registered with the Main Department will be issued with a temporary or permanent residence permit.
A temporary residence permit is valid for one year and is issued for a person registered with NISS and who is not entitled to a permanent residence permit.
Refugees, however, do not need entry visa or residence permit to enter and live in the country.
Upon recognition of their refugee status, an identification card showing their status is issued.
Pending their application, they are issued with identification card attesting their asylum-seeker status.
They are not required to possess valid travel documents and international health certificate to enter the country.
Foreigners are not eligible to be civil servants.
However, foreigners are not covered in the government pension scheme unless bilateral or multilateral agreements provide otherwise.
However, MoLSA may vary the three years limit as required.
Where MoLSA ascertains that the foreigner is not required for the work, the work permit may be cancelled.
The ownership of immovable property is reserved for Ethiopian nationals only.
Furthermore, if a foreigner wants to engage in investment activities, he/she is entitled to own immovable property such as a dwelling house and other immovable property necessary for the investment.
Foreigners can invest in Ethiopia either with the status of a domestic investor (i.e., foreigners residing permanently in Ethiopia who prefer to be treated as domestic investors) or as foreign investors.
Foreigners of Ethiopian origin enjoy most of the rights Ethiopian nationals do.
The other objective of the law is to enable them to contribute their part to the development and well-being of their country with a spirit of patriotism in a responsible manner.
Accordingly, a foreign national of Ethiopian origin is issued with an identification card attesting such status.
The holder of this identification card enjoys most of the rights and privileges Ethiopian nationals exercise except the right to vote or be elected to any office at any level of government.
Article 2
The Constitution prohibits racial discrimination.
The Government has taken a number of measures to discharge its obligations with regard to the prohibition of racial discrimination.
These include legislative measures taken to incorporate the principle of non-discrimination into different laws including the Constitution and the establishment proclamations of government organs.
Accordingly, all public authorities and institutions are prohibited from engaging in any act of discrimination violating the right of equality guaranteed in the Constitution.
The principle of non-discrimination has also been included in various specific laws governing different public institutions.
For instance, the Federal Prison Administration is an organ of the federal Government vested with the responsibility of administering prisons within the jurisdiction of the federal Government.
According to its Establishment Proclamation (No. 365/2003), discrimination or any adverse distinction among prisoners on the grounds of gender, religion, political opinion, nation, nationality, or social origin is prohibited.
Furthermore, every prison warden is vested with the responsibility to perform his/her duties by fully respecting the human rights and democratic rights enshrined in the Constitution and international human rights instruments adopted by Ethiopia.
The code of conduct for judges, which was issued by the Federal Judges Administration Council, requires judges to be impartial in discharging their duties.
The code of conduct states that a judge should treat all litigants impartially and enforce rights equally among them.
According to the code of conduct of advocates, an advocate cannot refuse to render advocacy service on the basis, among others, of the client's social standing.
Any person may lodge a complaint with the Council against a federal judge who has breached this disciplinary rule.
Various disciplinary measures, including removal from office, may be taken against a judge who has breached the code of conduct.
Moreover, this Law states that a candidate cannot use, for election purposes, an identifying symbol that would offend any nationality, race or religion or cause animosity and conflict among different peoples.
The Labour Proclamation (No.  377/2003) prohibits discrimination by employers among workers on the basis of nationality, sex, religion, political outlook or any other similar condition.
Furthermore, the Proclamation prohibits the termination of an employment contract on the basis of workers' nationality, sex, religion, political outlook, race, colour, descent or lineage.
The code of conduct obliges associations to ensure that every individual benefits from their work without any discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin, race, sex, religion or any kind of opinion.
In addition, every association is expected to make sure that the tasks it performs are free from discrimination.
Non-observance of these rules results in the revocation of license in addition to any civil and criminal liability the association might be liable to.
The Ethiopian Broadcasting Agency has endorsed a directive to regulate and guide broadcasting programmes (Broadcasting Service Program and Operation Directive No.
According to the directive, any broadcasting programme should promote the culture of all nations, nationalities and peoples, tolerance among them and support the economic development endeavors of the country.
Furthermore, any programme should be free from partiality and the language used should not offend any culture or be opposed to public morality.
The right to equality has been guaranteed in the FDRE Constitution.
Regional states' constitutions also guarantee equality.
The Government has taken measures to review any polices, laws, and practices that might have discriminatory effect.
In this regard, measures that have been taken with regard to the working language of regional governments and the educational policy are notable.
With regard to language, all the languages in Ethiopia have equal State recognition as per the Constitution.
The working language of regional states is determined by the regions themselves.
The educational curriculum has been formulated in a way that has made mother tongue a medium of instruction, in line with the equal constitutional recognition of the languages of the nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia.
The EHRC is vested with the power to ensure that laws, regulations and directives as well as government decisions and orders do not contravene the human rights of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution.
Accordingly, the Commission is conducting research to examine the conformity of existing polices and laws with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and other international human rights instruments ratified by the country.
Since the right to equality and the principle of non-discrimination are enshrined in the Constitution and various human rights instruments, the Commission looks into laws which are in violation of the same while conducting its task.
And based on its research and findings, the Commission will transmit recommendations for amendments of laws and policies to relevant organs of the State.
The House of Federation (HoF) is the primary organ mandated to promote equality and unity among peoples and in so doing combats discrimination.
The Proclamation for the Consolidation of the House of Federation and Definition of its Powers and Responsibilities (No. 251/2001) stipulates the detailed activities to be carried out by the HoF while performing its mandate.
Non-governmental organizations, equally with governmental organs, have been regarded as key players in the implementation of the cultural policy of the country.
Hence, the Government encourages all non-governmental institutions to work to promote the culture of different nations, nationalities and peoples and has created conducive environment for the proper functioning of these institutions.
National human rights institutions in combating racial discrimination
One of the objectives of the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission is to promote awareness of human rights through education of the public, and see to it that human rights are protected, respected and fully enforced.
Its task of promoting awareness includes raising awareness regarding fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to equality, recognized under the Constitution and international human rights instruments ratified by the country.
Moreover, the Commission has the mandate to entertain complaints of human rights violations, including complaints of racial discrimination.
Attitudes of racial discrimination were deeply entrenched in the social, economic and political fabric of Ethiopian society.
Ethnic domination in government was also part of the Ethiopian history.
As a result, abolishing negative racial attitudes and views is an arduous task that requires huge resources and considerable time.
Formal legal pluralism under Ethiopia's constitutional order is confined to personal and family law.
Regarding the adjudication of disputes relating to personal and family laws, the Constitution does not preclude the application of religious or customary laws and courts where the parties consent.
The Constitutional provision that requires all officials to enforce and respect the rights enshrined in it including the right to equality, imposes obligations on customary and Sharia court judges.
Most legal matters are resolved by the legal institutions and frameworks established by the federal and regional constitutions, including customary and religious institutions.
In a country like Ethiopia, where there exists a vast diversity of culture, it is hardly possible to ignore the existence and active role of customary mechanisms which the public has adopted for centuries.
In some ethnic groups like the Somali, the Amhara and the Gumuz, local customary law is applied to govern their day-to-day affairs.
The Oromia Regional Government is looking for a way to incorporate the rules of customary laws applied by the society in the region into the formal legal order.
A project plan has been designed to carry out research on the customary systems operating in the region.
As the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, all citizens including community elders who take part in customary mechanisms of dispute resolution have the duty to obey it and ensure its observance.
Moreover efforts are made to ensure participation of community elders in training covering issues of rule of law, human rights and other training necessary to promote human rights.
Article 3
Ethiopia has consistently condemned racial segregation and apartheid, worked for their elimination and has been in the forefront of actions of the international community in this regard.
Various laws, administrative and judicial decisions have been passed on the prohibition of all forms of racial segregation to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of racial segregation.
Ethiopia was a party to South West Africa case (ICJ) in which it opposed racial segregation in South Africa.
Even though the case was rejected due to want of jurisdiction, Ethiopia had showed its commitment to abolish apartheid and racial segregation in South Africa.
Article 4
Dissemination of ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination against any person or group of persons: All such acts are offences under Ethiopian law.
This act has been covered as an offence in various provisions that prescribe criminal acts.
As per article 10 (2) (b) the of the Freedom of Press Proclamation No.
34/1992, the press shall have the duty to ensure any press products it issues or circulates is free from any accusation against nation, nationality or people.
The perpetrator is also subject to liabilities and penalties under the Criminal Code.
Article 30 (4) (a) of Broadcasting Service Proclamation No.
Moreover, article 30 (4) (c) reiterates the prohibitions under the press law stated above.
The liability of the perpetrator of this offence includes confiscation of the property used for the broadcasting in addition to the principal penalty.
The crime of genocide is one of the serious criminal acts punishable under the Criminal Code.  Article 269 of the Criminal Code provides that:
(a) Killing, bodily harm or serious injury to the physical or mental health of members of the group, in any way whatsoever or causing them to disappear; or
(b) Measures to prevent the propagation or continued survival of its members or their progeny; or
Moreover, article 274 of the Criminal Code provides that provoking and conspiring for the commission of genocide is punishable with rigorous imprisonment not exceeding five years.
By providing this, the law has given a legal protection for nations, nationalities and peoples from acts of genocide.
Acts of armed violence against a group of persons on the basis of ethnicity, race, colour or decent are thus made offences of serious nature.
The acts of violence noted above can be considered to threaten the unity of the peoples of Ethiopia and bring the destruction of the Federation.
Thus article 241 of Criminal Code regards such acts as attacks on the political or territorial integrity of the State.
The punishment for acts of violence falling under this provision is rigorous imprisonment ranging from ten years to twenty-five years or, in cases of exceptional gravity, life imprisonment or death.
The punishments prescribed for these offences show that acts of racial violence are some of the gravest offences under the Ethiopian criminal law.
Acts of racial violence may violate various legally protected interests of an individual such as life, physical well-being, health and property whether committed individually or collectively.
If the acts of violence against a certain person or group of persons protected under the Convention have resulted in death, the perpetrator(s) would be prosecuted for homicide.
Article 480 of the Criminal Code criminalizes the act of inciting people to commit acts of violence against the community or individuals by word of mouth, writing, image, gesture or otherwise.
The “community” and “individuals” may refer to certain members of the community who may be members of certain nations, nationalities or peoples.
Anyone who commits this offence is punishable with simple imprisonment or fine.
The law ensures that the press and the mass media are not employed for provoking dissension.
The provision of any assistance to racist activities including financing is an offence under Ethiopian law.
A person who assists criminal activities based on racism is liable to the punishment for the crime he assists to be committed.
Ethiopian law prohibits organizations, as well as organized and all other propaganda activities, which promote and incite racial discrimination.
The Constitution prohibits the formation of organizations which pursue illegal objectives.
Organizations that promote and incite racial discrimination clearly violate the right to equality enshrined in the Constitution and, therefore, are illegal and prohibited organizations.
The provisions criminalizing the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred apply to propaganda activities which promote and incite racial discrimination as well.
Provocative activities of racial discrimination are prohibited under the acts of racial violence discussed above.
Organized racial propaganda activities may also constitute criminal conspiracy for the commission of racially motivated crimes under article 38 of the Criminal Code.
The provision of the Criminal Code on criminal participation also applies for aggravation of punishments imposed on perpetrators of such acts.
Participation in organizations or activities which promote and incite racial discrimination is an offence under Ethiopian law.
Apart from provisions on criminal participation, article 482 of the Criminal Code prohibits the participation in forbidden societies, bands, meetings or assemblies.
Whosoever commits this offence is punishable with a fine not exceeding one thousand Birr (equivalent to US$100).
Organizations or activities which promote and incite racial discrimination fall under article 482 of the Criminal Code.
Public authorities or public institutions, national or local, shall not promote or incite racial discrimination lest they incur criminal liability.
Public institutions do not have criminal responsibility under the law.
Racial motives are regarded as an aggravating circumstance under the Criminal Code in two ways.
Under article 84 (1) (a) base motive of “hatred” serves as a general aggravating circumstance.
Article 86 provides for aggravating circumstances not expressly provided in the Code.
The courts have discretion to consider racial motives in a given crime as a general aggravating circumstance since such motives against the foundation of the Ethiopian polity - equality of nations, nationalities and peoples.
There is no specific legislation promulgated to give effect to article 4 of the Convention since the existing legal regime, as discussed above, is sufficient to criminalizing acts that the Convention proscribes as offences.
The above discussions reflect the practice before courts in entertaining offences having elements of racial discrimination element and therefore can show how the State is implementing its obligation under the Convention.
There are decisions given by courts and other state institutions in particular the EHRC regarding acts of racial discrimination provided by article 4 of the Convention.
Some of them are discussed under information provided for implementation of articles 5 and 6 of the Convention.
Article 5
The right to equal treatment before the tribunals and other organs administering justice is a constitutionally recognized right in Ethiopia.
The FDRE Constitution provides, “Everyone has the right to bring a justiciable matter to, and to obtain a decision or judgment by a court of law or any other competent body with judicial power” (art.
It accordingly guarantees equality of everyone not only before courts but also before organs with judicial power.
Furthermore, the Civil Procedure Code provides for paupership so that those who do not have sufficient means to bring a court action may do so without payment of court fees.  (art.
467) This is intended to ensure that there are no prohibitive costs undermining access to a court.
In criminal matters as well, the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, which provides rules for the administration of criminal justice, shall apply to all persons alike (art.
In both, no discrimination on the basis of race or nationality is allowed.
By this power, the Ministry can initiate civil proceedings on behalf of persons that are not capable of arguing their cases before courts.
The Constitution preserves customary law systems which are instrumental in the resolution of disputes.
However, article 9 provides that customary practices inconsistent with the Constitution shall be null and void.
By so doing the Ethiopian Constitution ensures that customary law practices which are not in conformity with human rights standards do not militate against access to justice.
The right to counsel is one of the fundamental rights of the accused under the FDRE Constitution.
Any person accused of a crime has the right to have a counsel of his/her choice.
The State provides a counsel for accused persons in case they do not have sufficient means to pay for a counsel and the trial without a counsel would result in miscarriage of justice (art.
In practice, the State provides counsel for accused persons with no sufficient means to pay, where the crime they are accused of may entail 15 years' imprisonment or more.
The Office of Public Defenders renders legal assistance for accused persons under the auspices of the Federal Supreme Court.
All accused persons have a constitutional right to request the assistance of an interpreter.
Implementing these constitutional provisions, courts provide interpreters to those who do not understand their working language.
At federal level, for instance, the working language is Amharic and courts are obliged to provide interpreters for those who do not understand Amharic.
Likewise in all regional states and in several zones and woredas where they have their own official languages, interpretation services are provided to those who do not speak the language used in those localities.
Interpreters are appointed either on a permanent or ad hoc basis.
Persons protected by the Convention enjoy the right to be promptly brought before courts like any other suspected persons.
No separate legislation on the matter is available regarding such people.
Except for delay triggered by resource constraint, nobody is detained for long because he/she belonged to this or another group.
The State recognizes the right of detained foreigners to talk to their consular offices (or embassies) in the country.
Immediately following their detention, their embassies are informed and the embassies as well as the detainees have free access to talk to one another.
There are 83,471 recognized refugees in Ethiopia, who are mostly from neighbouring States.
(see table 1 below) They are stationed at centres established through collaboration among concerned government organs and international organizations such as the UNHCR.
Since UNHCR has offices and employees at the centres for refugees, the refugees can freely contact the Office as well as its employees.
The human rights of refugees in Ethiopia are thus recognized.
Table 1
Recognized refugees in Ethiopia by origin
The FDRE Constitution outlaws any form of racial discrimination.
Other subordinate laws also prohibit racial discrimination.
For instance, the Prison Administration legislation states that “No distinction among prisoners should be made on grounds such as nation, nationality, or social origin”.
Under the same legislation, all prisoners are entitled to minimum standards of care and support that would help for their rehabilitation and their eventual integration into society.
These standards provided in the Proclamation and the Regulations relate mainly to access to food, health services, accommodation, and the right to be visited by family and friends.
All these are provided without discrimination on the basis of race to the extent resources permit (Prison Proc. 365/2003).
Moreover, according to the national report issued by the EHRC that surveyed the situation of human rights in 35 prisons, no incidence of racial discrimination was reported.
In discharging their responsibilities, judges are required to abide by the Constitution and other laws, which among others, enshrine respect for diversity.
The country has extradition treaties with few countries.
As per those treaties, there is a possibility of sending a convicted foreigner to his/her country to serve the prison term there.
This is carried out on the basis of reciprocity.
Liberty and security of persons
Article 16 of the FDRE Constitution entitled as the “right of the security of person” states that every one has the right to protection against bodily harm.
All federal and state organs do also assume the duty to respect and enforce this right (art.
He shall have the right to be specifically informed that there is sufficient cause for the arrest as soon as the person appears in court.
The right of habeas corpus is also entrenched in article 19 (4) of the Constitution.
Right to protection by the State
Regional states have the primary responsibility for ensuring for the maintenance of public order and security in their own jurisdiction.
Accordingly, it is incumbent upon state authorities to ensure that every person enjoys the same protection regardless of race and other prohibited grounds of discrimination.
HPR is also empowered to order (by joint decision with HoF) to intervene in regional states when state authorities are unable to arrest violations of human rights within their jurisdiction.
HPR may also order intervention where a regional state endangers the constitutional order in violation of the constitution.
There have been a few cases where racially motivated violence has occurred in the country.
Some of them are the conflict in Gambella (see paras.  101-105); between peoples living in Oromia and Benishangual Gumuz Regional States, and between ethnic groups living in Oromia Regional State and SNNPRS.
The Government has been taking different measures to prevent their occurrence.
One such measure is to bring those responsible for such violence to justice.
Another important measure has been the campaigns carried out to educate the public about equality of peoples, respect for one another, and tolerance.
Attempts have also been made to resolve ethnic conflicts through traditional methods.
Regardless of their official status no impunity is available for perpetrators of racially motivated violence.
Racially motivated violence is considered as an attack against the very foundation of the State and its constitutional system.
Finding all the culprits and bringing them to justice may sometimes be difficult.
Lack of witnesses and denial by those around such incidents can be cited among the difficulties encountered in combating impunity.
But despite the difficulties every effort has been made to bring the culprits to justice.
The Constitution, the Federal Police Proclamation (No.  313/2003) and the Federal Police Commission Administration Regulation (No.
The training emphasizes, among others, the rights of nations so that police officers will be conscious of ethnic diversity and always maintain the principle of non-discrimination.
Police regulations provide that any use of force by a police officer shall be reasonable, supported by law and on the basis of legal authorization.
In cases of violations of such rules, measures ranging from disciplinary action to accusation for criminal responsibility may be taken against violators.
Several police officers are dismissed or temporarily suspended from duty for participation in activities that favoured one or another nation or nationality in addition to their criminally liability.
The right to effective political participation
Due to the diversity of its peoples and past problems in accommodating diversity Ethiopia has adopted a federal government system with a view to addressing the problems.
However, federalism being a significant departure from the past centralized governance, its implementation has not been without challenges.
Different efforts have been exerted to guarantee its proper functioning.
These measures include those noted in the following paragraphs.
The first set of measures was related to the establishment and efficient and effective functioning of the institutions of federalism.
The second set of measures was related to revision of all legislation to take into account diversity.
The third related to a nation-wide campaign to promote equality of, respect for, and tolerance among the different ethnic groups in the country.
The fourth was the practical implementation of self-administration at the levels of zones and woredas.
Institutions such as the HPR, HoF, and Ministry of Federal Affairs play important roles in the implementation of federalism.
The HPR is given a constitutional mandate to protect the security of the different ethnic groups through its power of intervention in cases of violations of human rights in regional states.
Detailed procedures of intervention have been enacted to ensure timely and effective intervention thereby preventing human rights violations.
More specifically, the Ministry of Federal Affairs has been established and mandated with a crucial role of promoting peaceful co-existence among nations and nationalities and to that end it has been carrying out key activities.
The Ministry of Federal Affairs, with the view to proper implementation of rules of federalism, is empowered, among others, to:
Since conflict prevention and resolution is a continuous process, the Ministry, in the next few years, plans to:
Existing legislation has been reviewed to make it compatible with the federalism and rights of nations and nationalities and new legislation has been issued with a view to implementing federalism.
Judicial, executive, and other organs of the sates have been sensitized to be conscious of the diversity of the country.
According to the Constitution, every nation, nationality, and people has the right to self determination, including the right to secession.
This right shall come in to effect when:
(a) A demand for secession has been approved by two-third majority of the members of the legislative council of the Nation, Nationality, or people;
(b) A federal government has organized a referendum which must take place with in three years from the time it received the concerned councils decision for secession;
(c) The demand for secession is supported by a majority vote in referendum;
(d) The federal Government will have transferred its powers to the council of Nation, Nationality or people; and
(e) A division of assets is effected in the manner prescribed by law.
HoF has recognized the right of self-determination in many of its decisions.
For example, it recognized the right of the Silte ethnic group.
The Silte people claimed that they were distinct ethnic group having their own culture, language, psychological make up and who inhabit an identifiable territory.
Their claim to exercise the right to self-determination was finally reviewed by the HoF.
Accordingly, the right to self-determination and self-identification of the Silte people were recognized through referendum.
Nations and nationalities are allowed to administer their own affairs to the maximum extent possible.
Decentralization has been taking place to the level where peoples do not under normal circumstances have reason to resent one another due to domination of one language or culture over another.
Displacement has occurred in the country in few occasions.
For example, a number of people were displaced in 2006 and 2007 due to floods in Regional States such as SNNPRS and Somali Regional States.
A number of measures have been taken to help the victims by the federal and regional governments as well as NGOs.
Accordingly, thousands of metric tons of food, clothes, household items, and tents were distributed.
In addition to the emergency assistance provided by the federal and regional governments, large donations from international and local donors were received and used for the rehabilitation of those displaced by the flood.
Rehabilitation programmes such as temporary food for work programmes and permanent solutions such as protection of soil and water in those vulnerable areas have been undertaken.
Gambella Regional State
The conflict that occurred in Gambella on 13 December 2003 could, to a large extent, be attributed to political rivalry between the Agnuak and Nuer ethnic groups.
Their rivalry, partly instigated and encouraged by officials of the former military government, revolved around the extent of the political representation they had in the administration of the region.
This rivalry, which later spread to other ethnic groups and peoples living in the Regional State, was further exploited by political parties that claimed to have represented one or the other ethnic group.
The conflict that occurred on the 13 f December 2003 was the result of this complex of factors.
The conflict on that date and other related events afterwards caused the death of several people belonging to all nationalities and peoples in the region and the destruction of homes and properties.
Initially, it was the responsibility of the Regional Government to control the situation.
However, as the situation could not be controlled at the local level, the Regional Government sought the intervention of the federal Government.
Extending its assistance, the federal Government used the police, the defence force and the Ministry of Federal Affairs.
The federal police and the defence force arrived immediately and took control of and calmed the situation.
The Ministry also coordinated the assistance that had to be provided to people who were displaced, lost their homes, or their subsistence due to the conflict.
Funds collected from different sources were used for rehabilitation of those affected by the conflict.
Clan leaders were involved in calming the situation and returning those displaced to their homes.
In addition, peace conferences were organized with a view to promoting reconciliation among residents of the region.
While the police and the defence force were discharging their duties, allegations of human rights violations were made against them.
As a result, an independent Inquiry Commission to Investigate the Conflict that Occurred in Gambella Regional State was established by law with the object of investigating the incident and to submit a report to the HPR.
The Commission found that no institutional human rights violations were committed by the police or the defence force.
According to the Commission's report, the individuals that caused the loss of life and property belonged to the different groups in the Region.
All the cases were brought before first instance courts.
Most of those detained have been convicted, but some appeals to higher courts are still being heard.
Among those convicted were a member of the military and 6 police officers that received sentences ranging from 2 to 12 years' imprisonment.
Rehabilitation work such as rebuilding houses and the provision of food and clothing were carried out through the participation of the Government, donors, NGOs and others.
Oromia Regional State
Oromia exercises self-rule and the working language in the Region has been Oromifa, different from the federal working language, Amharic.
Six years ago the Government undertook criminal investigation and prosecution measures against suspected members of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), an organization based in Eritrea and committed to terrorist activities.
But later the OLF went out of the government preferring to wage war against the legitimate Government of the country.
Even more it has become a terrorist group engaging in various terrorist activities such as killing innocent peoples, enforced disappearance, torture and other inhuman treatments against civilians.
While this is the reality, there were allegations that the Government's actions against members of OLF amounted to human rights violations.
But in fact all the measures to investigate and prosecute members of the OLF were taken in accordance with the law.
Suspects were arrested, investigated, and prosecuted by regular courts.
Those found guilty were sentenced, while those suspected of involvement but not proven to have committed any criminal act were released by court order.
Ethnic conflicts have occurred in some of the regional states in the country.
These conflicts are triggered mostly by water or water use, border issues, grazing land, and lack of good governance.
Although some such ethnic conflicts have been settled through mechanisms such as referendum (for example the border conflict between Oromia and Somali Regional States) some remain unsettled even today.
The Government is presently determined to provide permanent solutions to all such disputes.
Temporary measures such as ensuring the presence of the police in conflict areas are taken.
For more permanent solutions, the causes of conflicts and possible resolution are being studied and a national strategy for dispute prevention and resolution is being formulated and debated.
The Ministry of Federal Affairs is tasked with strategy formulation, manual preparation, and organization of conferences on conflict prevention and resolution.
As the previous “fire fighting” approach of conflict resolution has not succeeded, more efforts are now directed towards prevention; and an “early warning system” is being studied with the assistance of UNDP.
Female genital mutilation has been one of the most harmful traditional practices practiced in many parts of the country.
The government, civil society organizations, and others have been campaigning for a long time to eradicate the practice.
Civil societies, especially those involved in the protection and promotion of the rights of women including women's associations themselves, have been playing crucial roles in the elimination of this harmful practice.
The difficulty encountered has been the perception of most communities that the practice is normal and even important.
However, the preventive and educative roles of the Criminal Code, coupled with an aggressive campaign by all concerned to eliminate the practice have all contributed to a significant decrease in the practice.
As female genital mutilation is committed by one's own family, no racial discrimination is involved.
The Constitution provides for communities to be consulted with respect to policies and projects affecting them as part of the provision on the right to development.
Accordingly, people have the right to full consultation and to the expression of views in the planning and implementation of environmental policies and projects that affect them directly.
Implementing the Constitution, a law was promulgated to provide for adequate displacement compensation for rural landholders.
As a result rural landholders, who might have lost their land due to public works and investment, were given compensation and substitute lands.
National parks, for example, are maintained through the participation of the people located around the parks.
Revenues obtained from the parks are shared with the local community.
Local communities are employed in the parks and the traditional administration methods of those communities are also applied ensuring communities' participation as well as development of those practices.
All this is believed to have contributed to the cultivation of the feeling of belongingness on a part of those communities.
Since every child has the right to attend primary education, all refugee centres in Ethiopia have primary schools (from Grade 1 to Grade 8), with necessary books, educational materials, and teachers.
Child refugees attend these schools.
In addition, refugee children who have passed the national examination administered at Grade 8 have the opportunity to attend secondary education in nearby government schools.
Refugee centres established in Ethiopia fulfil basic standards.
They are established with basic services such as water, food, and shelter.
Medical centres with necessary medical staff and medical supplies are also provided.
The right to vote is affirmed under Article 38 of the FDRE Constitution.
Article 38(2) also enshrines the right of everyone to join political parties, trade unions, chambers of commerce, employers' and professional associations.
The detailed application of these principles is provided in the election Law adopted in 2007.
Article 38 of the Constitution enshrines the right of every citizen to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives.
In effect nations, nationalities and peoples are represented in the parliaments at the federal and regional level.
The need for special representation is also established by the Constitution where minority nation, nationalities and peoples shall have at least 20 seats in the parliament (House of Peoples Representative).
The criteria of who falls within this category are established by decision of the HoF.
The HoF is composed of representatives of nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia.
The HoF currently has 112 members drawn from 69 nations, nationalities and peoples across the country represented in the 9 state councils.
Table 2
Representation of nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia in the House of Federation
In a pioneer decision, the HoF has affirmed the equal representation of nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia.
In the regional state of Benishangul Gumuz, registered candidates were prohibited from participating in the election on the ground that they did not speak one of the languages of the Region.
The candidates were from the Oromo, Amhara and Tigray ethnic groups who had been living in the Region for a long time.
The HoF decided that nations, nationalities and peoples should not be discriminated on the basis of language and ruled that the candidates had the right to stand as candidates.
The decision serves as a precedent in other regions as well.
There is wide representation of nations, nationalities and peoples' of Ethiopia in government institutions.
In all law enforcement organs such as the police, prosecutors and judges, efforts are exerted to ensure the proportional representation of all nations, nationalities, and peoples.
Although complete data is not available regarding their representation, regulations require fair representation of nations and nationalities.
For example, the recruitment of police officers and staff in the prison administration is based on the equitable representation of nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia.
Special measures are adopted to ensure balance is achieved; a recruit from a nation or nationality with relatively less representation is given priority in employment.
The Police Commission also makes special effort to enable members of a nation or nationality with less representation to become members of the police.
In the judiciary, nations and nationalities are similarly represented at the federal and regional level.
Hence, judges from ethnic groups of Amhara, Oromia and Tigray constitute 39.2 per cent, 15.5 per cent and 22.4 per cent of numbers respectively.
Other nations and nationalities also have representation in the judiciary proportionate to their population.
The origins of the National Defence Forces lie in the army of the EPRDF that overthrew the former military regime.
That was the beginning of the Defence Forces.
But afterwards several measures have been taken to ensure the fair representation of nations and nationalities in the Defence Forces.
Those measures start with the Constitution which requires the Defence Forces to be composed of an equitable representation of nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia.
The proclamation enacted to establish the Defence Forces also requires a fair representation of nations, nationalities and peoples in the Defence Forces.
To implement these provisions, a series of demobilization measures were taken and new recruits drawn from nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia in place of those demobilized.
At recruitment, special measures have been adopted.
Among candidates that satisfy the requirements on an equal footing, preference is given to members of nationalities comparatively less represented in the Defence Forces.
In addition, qualifications are lowered for the nations, nationalities and peoples least represented in the Defence Forces in order to enhance their participation.
Those measures have resulted in fair representation of all nations and nationalities in the Defence Force, except in the highest ranks where some nations and nationalities have yet to be represented because of lack of experience.
The powers and responsibilities of the Defence Force are provided for in the Constitution, other legislation, regulations and directives.
In addition to protecting the sovereignty of the country from outside forces, the principal task of the Defence Forces is maintenance of peace and security.
Fulfilment of these tasks may sometimes mean the deployment of the Defence Force to curb public disturbances, ethnic conflicts, and situations requiring public emergency.
This has happened in a few cases where local authorities and the police have been unable to control such incidents.
In such situations, the members of the Defence Force are deployed temporarily until the situation becomes regularized and returns to the control of the police and local authorities.
When such engagements are required, the Defence Force works under strict guidelines as to the conduct and means of engagement.
The Government, basing itself on the Constitution, has issued rules of engagement.
If this is unsuccessful, the Defence Forces are required to provide oral warning, a show of weaponry, followed by firing in the air to encourage those involved in the conflict to stop or withdraw.
It is only as a last resort that the use of force is allowed.
In all circumstances, the principles of neutrality and proportionality must be maintained.
Moreover, the assistance of elders to employ traditional mechanisms of dispute settlement has always to be sought.
The above rules and guidelines are implemented strictly and violations are not tolerated.
While the great majority of members of the Defence Forces strictly observe these rules and guidelines, some infringements have been observed on a few occasions.
Following such activities, disciplinary measures have been taken or other forms of punishments imposed.
The right to freedom of movement and residence within border of the State
Any Ethiopian national has also the right to return to his/her country.
Special laws have been enacted, including the refugee law and immigration law, for the implementation of this right taking into account the different circumstances for the implementation of the right.
Ethiopia has a long history of drought and at times famine.
Different measures have been taken by the Government to address this chronic problem.
Resettlement of drought affected people to fertile lands has on occasions been the best solution to the problem.
A programme of resettlement has been undertaken in four regional states - Oromia, Amhara, SNNPRS, and Tigray.
The programme, which is one of the three components of the food security program designed by the Government to provide a permanent solution for food insecurity, has been carried out under strict conditions.
The programme is carried out in collaboration with the Government, donors, and NGOs, and has little room for abuse.
Deportation of a foreigner
127 Deportation of foreigners is done in accordance with the law.
Any decisions on deportation are appealable.
The Refugee Proclamation shall be applied without discrimination as to race, religion, and nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
The Law in particular provides for the need for taking measures to ensure the protection of women refugees, refugee children, elderly refugees and handicap that needs special protection.
Consequently, the Government provides protection to these groups of people from human rights violations that could arise due to their vulnerability.
According to the Refugee Proclamation, refugees are entitled to other rights and subject to the duties contained in the Refugee Convention and the OAU Refugee Convention.
The Administration of Refugees and Returnees Affairs, a national mechanism for the administration of refugees under National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), was established in 2003.
In order to preserve the protection and well-being of refugees, the Government works in collaboration with UNHCR and WFO and with other non-governmental organizations through its Office of the Administration of Refugees and Returnees Affairs.
Every recognized refugee has the right of his/her own will, to seek to repatriation from Ethiopia to his/her country of nationality or former habitual residence in safety and dignity.
As a rule, a refugee who is a lawful resident of Ethiopia shall not be expelled save on grounds of national security and public order.
For example, after an expulsion decision has been made, a reasonable period of time is provided to enable such refugees to seek admission to a country other than that to which he/she is to be expelled.
Moreover, an order to expel can only be given by the head of NISS and the concerned refugee is also allowed to present his/her case.
The right to leave any country, including one's own, and to return to one's country
The right to a nationality
As a constitutional right, no Ethiopian national shall be deprived of his/her Ethiopian nationality against his/her will.
Similarly, every Ethiopian national has the right to change his/her Ethiopian nationality and no Ethiopian shall lose his/her nationality by the decision of a government official.
This right has some restrictions.
Ethiopian nationality may also be accorded to foreigners in accordance with the law and procedures which are consistent with international agreements ratified by Ethiopia.
According to the Ethiopian nationality law all Ethiopian nationals have equal rights and obligations of citizenship regardless of the manner in which nationality is obtained.
Nationals who acquired Ethiopian nationality by law are to be treated equally with Ethiopian nationals by birth.
Any foreigner may acquire Ethiopian nationality as long as he/she satisfies the requirements of the law which indicates the right is given for all non-nationals of Ethiopia without discrimination.
A residence permit is issued for foreigners who satisfy legal requirements without discrimination of any kind.
Ethiopia has issued a directive to determine the status of Eritreans living in Ethiopia.
According to the Nationality Law, an Ethiopian who acquires another nationality will be taken as one who has renounced his/her Ethiopian nationality.
Hence while an Eritrean who opted to hold his/her Ethiopian nationality remained an Ethiopian, other Eritreans who voluntarily acquired Eritrean nationality lost their Ethiopian nationality due to renunciation.
The minor may retain his/her Ethiopian nationality by renouncing his/her other nationality within one year of attaining his/her majority unless there has been an earlier express renunciation of his/her Ethiopian nationality by the decision of his/her parents.
Hence, an Eritrean minor may acquire Ethiopian nationality in the absence of explicit renunciation to the Ethiopian nationality upon application.
Right to marriage and choice of spouse
According to the FDRE Constitution all men and women who attained marriageable age (18) have the right to marry and found a family without distinction as to race, nation, nationality or religion.
Marriage of an Ethiopian national of either sex to a foreign national shall not annul his/her Ethiopian nationality.
A marriage conducted outside of Ethiopia is also recognized under Ethiopian law so long as it does not infringe public morality.
The Constitution also recognizes religious and customary marriages so long as they do not contradict the Constitution including its basic principles of human rights.
Since family matters are left to regional states, new family codes have been adopted by the regional states in addition to the Federal Family Code.
The right to own property alone as well as in association with others
The FDRE Constitution provides that every Ethiopian citizen has the right to the ownership of private property individually or in common.
It also states that land is common property of the nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia and shall not be subject to sale or to other means of exchange.
Ethiopian farmers also have the right to obtain land without payment and the protection against eviction from their possession.
Pastoralists also have the right to free land for grazing and cultivation as well as the right not to be displaced from their lands.
To guarantee the security of tenor of farmers, there is an ongoing process of issuing a certificate of possession which is transferable to descendants.
Women, according to the Constitution, have the right without discrimination to acquire, administer, control use and transfer property.
Women who want to engage in agriculture shall have the right to get and use rural land.
A policy which involves wider consultation with the community and clan leaders so as to ensure its acceptability is underway and will be enacted with the essence of providing a system that ensures equal use of land.
The right to inherit
In accordance with the Ethiopian Civil Code, every person has the right to inheritance.
The FDRE Constitution accords women equal treatment in the inheritance of property with men.
Even though the implementation of this right should be without discrimination to any women, women in some regions face difficulty to inherit equally with men owing to discriminatory traditional and customary practices.
For instance, in the Afar region some property including camels cannot be inherited by women.
In Somali region, women lack equal right of inheritance as customary courts award women no more than a one third share of the whole property.
The Government has been taking measures to address this problem principally through active involvement of the communities and awareness creating campaigns and education.
The right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion
The Constitution provides for freedom of religion.
Thus every one has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.
State and religion are separate and there is no State religion; besides, the State does not interfere in religious matters nor vice versa. Religious influence in education is prohibited.
This is a clear departure from previous regimes.
In Ethiopia there is a strong culture of tolerance and shared respect between the various religions and peoples of different religions have lived in harmony for a very long time.
The Government media transmits adequately celebrations of religious holidays giving due focus on how they are exercised and their cultural impact.
Traditional religious practices are also respected.
For instance, the Oromo practice of “Erecha”, neglected in the past, is now recognized and practiced every year with wide publicity.
The right to freedom of opinion and expression
Every one has the right to hold opinions and has freedom of expression without interference which includes the freedom to speak, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds.
This right is given without discrimination of any kind.
Freedom of the press and other media and freedom of artistic creativity is also guaranteed without the prohibition of any form of censorship.
The right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association
The right to assemble and to demonstrate is given to everyone on the condition that such activity is peaceful and unarmed.
Nonetheless, the exercise of this right shall not affect the well being of youth or the honour and reputation of individuals.
Any propaganda of war and any public expression of opinions intended to injure human dignity are prohibited.
Every person has the right to freedom of association for any cause or purpose which also includes the corollary right of not to be compelled to join an association.
Nonetheless, it is illegal to be organized in violation of the law or to illegally subvert the constitutional order or to promote such activities.
There is also increasing involvement of non governmental organizations in advocacy, human rights and civic education.
Various NGOs engage in advocacy in the area of non-discrimination; however, there is no specific information on non-governmental organizations engaged in the area of prohibition of racial discrimination.
Economic, social and cultural rights (art.
The Constitution contains provisions which are relevant to the protection of economic, social and cultural rights.
For example, article 41 of the FDRE Constitution reads as follows:
The Constitution does also guarantee economic, social and cultural rights in other provisions.
Indeed, it is evident from the list of provisions of the Constitution that the rights to health as well as housing are guaranteed implicitly.
Right to work, employment (conditions of work, trade union, and pension)
Ethiopia is a party to several Conventions of the International Labour Organization, which provide for the right to work, including to the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention.
In the labor proclamation, the right to employment is protected through the prevention of discrimination between workers on the basis, among others, of nationality.
This prohibition applies for all conditions of work including the right to join or not to join a trade union.
Actually, an employee who is dismissed on the grounds of nationality, race, colour, and linage is entitled to reinstatement (unless the employee wants otherwise).
A discriminatory act is punishable under the employment law (unless the Criminal Code provides more severe punishment).
With the exception of the requirement for a work permit, no discrimination is allowed on the ground that an employee is a foreigner.
So the working conditions and the right to join trade unions are equally granted to non-citizens.
Although no problems of employment are currently identified in relation to foreigners, studies are underway to identify and provide solutions to them.
For civil servants, no discrimination among job seekers is allowed in filling vacancies on the grounds, among others, of ethnic origin.
Under the Civil Servants Proclamation, affirmative measures in recruitment are also guaranteed.
The practical implementation of the Proclamation that requires preference to be given to members of nationalities is the awarding of two extra points for employment of people coming from less developed regional states.
“Equal pay for equal work” is also the feature of Civil Service non-discrimination rule.
Federal Civil Service Agency has the power and the responsibility to investigate allegations of discrimination and order corrective measures and take administrative actions against officials found responsible for discriminatory acts.
The Agency has exercised such powers on several occasions.
Racial discrimination in employment is not a frequent allegation before courts and tribunals.
However, as part of the general allegation of racial discrimination in social, economic and cultural rights, some petitions have been made before the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission.  Currently, those allegations are under investigation.
Without any discrimination, all government employees, including members of the police and the military, are entitled to a pension.
If they have any grievances, they have the right to appeal in accordance with social security laws (Public Servants Pension Proclamation 345/2003).
The right to form and join trade unions
The provision goes on to provide that the right shall include the right to form trade union and other associations, and to negotiate with their employers and other organizations affecting their interests.
The right to housing
The Constitution provides for the right to property including immovable property on land.
This means every one is entitled to own a house.
In practice, financial difficulties may impair ownership of a house.
In order to alleviate these problems of housing, the government is building condominiums and is distributing them for people in the lower income group, without any discrimination at cost price through a lottery method.
No racial discrimination is observed in the selling or renting of houses or apartments.
The Constitution provides for farmers' right to obtain land and for protection against eviction.
Pastoralists have also the right to free land for grazing and cultivation as well as the right not to be displaced from their own lands.
To implement these rights, strategies and programmes were designed and several activities were carried out.
One important aspect of such activities has been the studies on the expansion of infrastructure carried out by the Ministry of Federal Affairs, with the assistance of the World Bank and the International Fund for Agricultural Development.
One guiding principle in implementation of such projects is the preservation of culture in development activities.
The right to public health, medical care, social security and social services
To the extent the country's resources permit, policies shall aim to provide all Ethiopians access to public health and education, clean water, housing, food and social security (social objectives).
The national health policy also provides for assurance of access to health care for all segments of the population with special assistance for those who cannot afford to pay.
Health centres at woreda level are established by the Government; all people without discrimination are entitled to these services with minimum cost to themselves.
Free medical service is also provided for those who cannot afford it otherwise.
In vulnerable areas, provision of food, resettlement, and safety net programmes.
Safety net programmes allow those affected to be employed in labour intensive public work so that they can earn their living.
Moreover, direct assistance is given to those that are not capable of working.
Other forms of assistance include provision of loan and other packages including water resources development, animal resources development, and various commodities development.
Resettled people (social, economic and cultural rights)
The social, economic and cultural rights of resettled people are protected.
On the basis of resettlement regulation, resettled people are provided with food until the next harvest.
Distribution of household items for each family is made.
Various services institutions such as health centres, schools, and mills have been established; roads constructed; and a supply of potable water has been made available.
Depending on circumstances at the place of resettlement, land for cultivation, seeds and fertilizers, and plough oxen were provided so that resettled people would be engaged in development activities immediately.
For instance, excluding the resettlement of the 2006/2007, more than 90 per cent of the resettled have become self-sufficient.
Currently, resettlement is within the region.
Since there is no resettlement from one region to another, no feeling of estrangement is likely to occur on the part of the resettled.
As the resettled are located to areas within their own region where they are native, their right to effective political participation and cultural preservation is ensured.
Poverty reduction
Efforts are exerted to reduce poverty through formulation and implementation of poverty eradication policies and programmes.
For regions that are less developed, special measures such as provision of budgetary assistance have been taken.
The activities of the Board that coordinates assistance to less developed regions from the federal and regional governments, donors and others have provided a great opportunity to improve the lives of people living in those regions.
The education policy aims at ensuring equity and fair distribution of educational opportunity (across regions, religion, gender, social class, etc).
One of its prime objectives is recognition of the right of nations/nationalities to learn in their language, while at the same time providing one language for national and another for international communication.
Making the necessary preparation, nations and nationalities are entitled to either learn in their own language or choose from among those selected on the basis of national and countrywide distribution.
The language of teacher training for kindergarten and primary education is also the language used in the area (Education and Training Policy of the FDRE).
On the basis of the education policy objectives stated above, positive measures to expand education to nations and nationalities that were less represented in education are being implemented.
The policy aims at achieving universal enrolment in primary school by 2015.
It is believed that this trend will increase the number of students from less-developed regions represented in institutions of higher education.
Other measures include opening alternative schools such as boarding schools and hostels.
In regions or zones where the language is relatively well developed and has a sufficient number of teachers trained in that language, education in the mother tongue is given up to grade eight.
Such is the situation in Oromia, Amhara, and Tigray Regional States.
The medium of instruction in higher and tertiary education is principally English.
The study of one additional language is encouraged.
In pastoralist and semi-pastoralist areas, alternative basic education is being given.
Special training manuals for teachers, special directives for implementation, and special directives to regulate boarding schools in these areas have been designed and implemented.
The right to equal participation in cultural activities
Under the Constitution, equality of languages and preservation of historical and cultural legacies are guaranteed.
The Constitution also provides that all Ethiopian languages shall enjoy equal state recognition (art. 5 (2)).
The Ministry of Culture and Tourism was established for the implementation of the policy.
The powers and duties of the Ministry include:
Also notable in this regard is the establishment of an institute under the Council of Nationalities in SNNPRS, where more than 65 per cent of the total nations and nationalities reside.
Studies are being made to rescue languages on the verge of extinction.
Community broadcasting, which among other things promotes and develops the language, culture and artistic values of the community is allowed for those interested in the promotion of cultures.
The law with the purpose of preventing prejudices in the media prohibits any programme that maliciously accuses or defames nation/nationalities.
Broadcasting directives require that 50 per cent of musical programmes have to be allotted to the cultures and musical programmes of nations and nationalities.
Radio and Television channels owned by the government also have programmes exclusively intended to promote and preserve the culture, language, historical and natural heritages of nations and nationalities.
Every effort is exerted to make peoples aware of each other's culture and language.
In entertainment programmes such as “our music, arts and culture”, practices of marriage, dressing, mourning and other aspects of nations, nationalities and peoples are introduced.
The national programmes aim at languages widely spoken such as Amharic, Oromifa, Tigrigna, Somali, and Somali.
In areas where there are dissemination centres, other languages such as Hadari, Agnwak and Nuer are in use.
In national programmes, people are encouraged to express their opinions in native languages while translations are made to the audience.
Although regular programmes are not made for some small nations and nationalities, time is allotted for transmission of their music and songs (e.g. the programme of music of nations and nationalities).
Technical assistance is frequently extended by the Government to those interested in making programmes that promote culture and language of nationalities.
There are also programmes on pastoralists and semi-pastoralists (see the core document on language use for media).
The eradication of racial hatred, prejudice and intolerance among peoples requires a number of measures, the principal being awareness raising campaigns.
Despite considerable efforts with a significant success, there still are racial prejudices.
As a result, campaigns, through education and the media, have continued to advocate the equality and tolerance among peoples.
Massive eye-catching billboards depicting nations and nationalities, reflecting their diversity, and at the same time their equality and unity are displayed in all public places.
Almost all media programmes-entertainment, educational programmes, etc - work towards the eradication of prejudices and intolerance among people.
In some cases officials who tend to hold prejudices against a nationality or another have been removed from their position.
Chapter three of the FDRE Constitution provides a right for every Ethiopian national to have equal access to publicly funded services.
In practice, there is no discrimination in the use of services.
Article 6
Effective protection and remedies
Ethiopia has an independent judiciary charged with the power of enforcing the rights entrenched in the Constitution.
Furthermore, like all organs of government, the decentralization policy ensures that the hierarchy of courts goes down to the grass root level permitting easy access.
The judiciary affords effective protection and remedies to victims of racial discrimination whether committed by private individuals or state officials.
There are also other institutions that give effective protection and remedies to victims of racial discrimination.
Notable in this respect are the EHRC, the Institution of the Ombudsman and NEBE.
These organs have a mandate to receive complaints of racial discrimination and provide appropriate remedies.
The rights to speedy trial and to be heard which are guaranteed in the Constitution, are ensured to victims of racial discrimination by the courts and other institutions.
Victims of racial discrimination, their families and witnesses have the right to access information regarding the progress of the proceedings they institute.
Several measures have been taken to ensure that victims with limited resources do not fear the cost and complexity of the judicial process.
This enables victims with limited resources to institute action without fear of the cost of the judicial process.
Training on the new Federal Criminal Code has been given to relevant authorities, drawing attention and increasing awareness to racially motivated offences.
Police and judicial authorities are trained to give due attention and respond positively to cases of racial discrimination.
Moreover, training has been given to the public on various human rights topics to reduce and eliminate social censure or reprisals on the victims of racial discrimination.
The federal Government intervenes in regional states in a variety of circumstances to give effective protection and remedies to victims of discrimination.
Upon request of a regional state council or the highest executive organ to the Prime Minister through the Ministry of Federal Affairs, the federal Government intervenes where grave and deteriorating security conditions in regional states occur.
The Federal Police or National Defence Force intervenes to assist regional law enforcement organs to maintain law and order through the use of appropriate measures proportionate to the circumstances.
HPR may also give effective protection and remedies to the victims of racial discrimination.
The team compiles and submits, with recommendations, information gathered within the region where the alleged acts of violations of the human rights have been committed.
HPR presents a report with justification to the joint session of HPR and HOF on the necessity of the intervention of the federal Government.
This intervention enables the victims of racial discrimination to get remedies.
Referenda were conducted in different parts of the country to provide solutions to conflicts over land claims among ethnic groups residing in neighboring regions.
Referenda were conducted in many areas of Oromia and Somali regions to assess and public opinion.
The referenda were instrumental in resolving some of the conflicts.
Public conferences and discussions between heads of regional states are held at various levels to prevent the occurrence of and/or provide lasting remedies to ethnic conflicts, at regional states, zonal, and other lower administrative levels.
The conferences are organized by governments and NGOs.
These conferences and discussions help eliminate misconceptions among ethnic groups and contribute towards building lasting peace.
Some neighbouring states have established peace committees at various levels of administrative hierarchies which meet regularly to monitor the peace and security of their localities and resolve any issues of ethnic conflicts that may arise.
Afar National Regional State has established peace committees at neighbouring Kebeles, Woredas and Zones with the national regional states of Tigray, Amhara and Oromia and also at the inter-state level.
The Committees have been successful in maintaining the peaceful coexistence of the people in the boarder areas of the states.
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC)
The EHRC has the power to receive and investigate all complaints on human rights violations made against any person.
A complaint may be lodged by a person claiming that his/her rights are violated or, by his/her spouse, family member, representative or by a third party.
The Commission may, in consideration of the gravity of the allegation of the violations, receive anonymous complaints.
Hence the Commission has the mandate to receive and consider individual complaints of racial discrimination.
The Commission attempts to settle complaints brought before it amicably.
It notifies, in writing, the findings of its investigation, and its opinion thereon, to the superior head of the concerned organ and to the complainant.
Since its establishment the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission has undertaken numerous activities to ensure protection and promotion of human rights.
It has entertained and gave remedy to numerous complaints of racial discrimination.
The following table itemizes some of the complaints received and the remedies given by the Commission.
Table 3
Complaints received and the remedies given by the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission
The Institution of the Ombudsman
The Institution of the Ombudsman has the power to receive and investigate complaints and to give remedies in respect of maladministration.
Maladministration includes acts committed, or decisions given, by executive government organs, in contravention of administrative laws, the labour law or other laws relating to administration.
These laws have incorporated non-discrimination as a basic principle.
A complaint may be lodged with the Institution by a person claiming to have suffered from maladministration or, by his/her spouse, family member, his/her representative or by a third party.
The Institution may, in consideration of the gravity of the maladministration committed, receive anonymous complaints.
The Institution receives and investigates complaints free of charge and attempts to settle complaints brought before it amicably.
It notifies, in writing, the findings of its investigation and its opinion thereon, to the head of the concerned organ and to the complainant.
Accordingly the Institution has the mandate to receive and resolve individual complaints of racial discrimination.
Although individual complaints with principal allegation of racial discrimination are rare, some allegations of violations of human rights are believed to relate to racial discrimination.
Reparation and satisfaction
Various provisions in different laws provide for reparation and satisfaction that also apply to victims of racial discrimination.
The Civil Code (art.
2028) states that whosoever causes damage to another by fault has to make it good; infringing any mandatory provisions of the law is a fault (art.
The Criminal Code (arts.  101 and 102) also provides for reparation to be paid to victims of a criminal act.
The Convention on Racial Discrimination is part and parcel of the law of the land and transgressing the mandatory provisions of the same is a fault.
The victims of racial discrimination are, therefore, entitled to compensation where their rights are violated.
The amount of compensation awarded to victims of racial discrimination is equal to the damage caused by the act giving rise to the liability.
Future damage which is certain to occur can be made good without waiting for it to materialize.
Compensation can be given in the form of restitution, reprimand or injunction.
The court may grant an injunction restraining the defendant from committing, from continuing to commit or from resuming an act prejudicial to the plaintiff.
The government usually engages in rehabilitation of victims of racial discrimination where grave damage is caused to them.
In civil proceedings the burden of proof is the onus of the plaintiff.
The preponderance of evidence submitted by one of the parties is sufficient to prove the case in civil proceedings.
The same principle is applicable to civil proceedings involving racial discrimination as in ordinary civil suits.
The burden of proof is not different or lessened in civil proceedings involving racial discrimination.
Ethiopia has not made the optional declaration provided for in article 14 of the Convention.
This is due to resource constraint which adversely affects the capacity of the State to implement the article.
Conflict among various ethnic groups is amicably resolved through the customary dispute settlement mechanism.
The decision of elders is unanimously accepted, respected and brings lasting peace to the conflict.
Customary dispute settlement awards satisfactory compensation to the victims of the conflict.
Article 7
Education and teaching
The Government took several measures in the field of education to change the inequality that existed in the past.
The previous education system did not conform to the UNESCO principles particularly those relating to compulsory primary education, and the right of every child to learn in its mother tongue.
As a result, it did not take cognizance of the diverse culture, history, custom, attributes and contributions of the various nation and nationalities found in the country.
Taking these into account, the current Government has adopted a national education policy which has the objective, among others, of:
To achieve the objectives of the educational policy, one of the issues which had been given priority was changing the curriculum.
The previous educational curriculum did not incorporate human rights.
In an effort to improve the quality and relevance of the curriculum, special attention was given to relate the content with the realities in the country and the new democratic order.
The new civics and ethical education, now included in to the curriculum is based on major social values.
The course urges students to know their rights and duties in the society and live in equality, mutual respect and trust with their fellow citizens.
Moreover, the course aims to create democratic and responsible citizens that safeguard their rights and respect the rights of others, develop tolerant culture and resolve differences peacefully.
Civics education is given at all levels.
Furthermore, a civics and ethical education course has been included in pre-service and in-service teachers training at all levels.
The syllabus of the course devotes large portion of its content to human rights issues.
Human and democratic rights enshrined in the Constitution are exhaustively dealt with.
In addition, specific topics have been assigned to elaborate on the relation between diversity, tolerance, peace and equality among nation, nationalities and peoples.
As far as textbook preparation is concerned, not only have there been changes in content, but also the manner of their preparation was changed.
While preparing student texts, great care is taken to ensure that there is no usage of language or expressions that are derogative.
Moreover, the content of the curriculum is made to reflect respect for the identity of all nations, nationalities and peoples in accordance with the principle of equality of nation, nationalities and peoples.
The House of Federation, as an organ with the mandate to promote equality, has the responsibility to follow up whether the curricula of educational institutions incorporate academic subjects that promote unity and equality among peoples.
The House works in cooperation with the Ministry of Education in order to dispose of its responsibility.
In the course of designing the school curriculum, substantial effort has been made to incorporate in the textbooks sections that introduce the cultural, traditional and linguistic background of different nationalities.
Primary school textbooks in particular have been based on the realities of the specific regional state and on the culture and achievements of the local populations.
Furthermore, the content of textbooks has been made to reflect the realities and the values of the Ethiopian peoples, nations and nationalities.
The effort to introduce the cultural diversity found in the country has been achieved through history, language, social science and civics and ethical education courses.
The Ministry of Education also provides educational programmes regarding the culture and custom of nation, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia using broadcasting media.
It publishes books and research papers on culture in order to enhance the culture of tolerance.
Police officers receive basic police training prior to joining the police force both at the federal and state level.
The objective of the training is to create professional police officers dedicated to the enforcement of the Constitution and human rights enshrined therein.
The training, inter alia, contains courses regarding human rights, good governance, rule of law and police and non-discrimination.
Moreover, in the police college specific courses are given regarding international human right instruments.
Furthermore, the standard of the training given is in line with the United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials.
Besides the formal police training, trainings have been given to police forces by non-governmental organizations and the International Committee of the Red Cross regarding human rights.
Inducing changes in cultural attitude beliefs and practices retarding social progress, is also one of the duties vested in the Ministry.
The Ministry works to expand cultural institutions in order to institutionalize public participation in the field of culture and to preserve and promote cultural values and traditions of the society.
It also publishes periodic and yearly magazines, incorporating the researches conducted on the culture and history of different nationalities found in different regions of the country and disseminates the same.
Regional Culture and Tourism Bureaus play major role in promoting the culture and traditions of nations, nationalities and peoples found in their respective regions.
They produce radio and television programmes to be transmitted to the public regarding cultural diversity and the traditions of different nationalities.
These programmes play a major role in creating awareness regarding diverse cultures and promoting tolerance among the people.
They also assist and promote culture related extra-curricular activities of schools.
This celebration enables the nation, nationalities and peoples in the country to know the culture, history, and identity of each other.
About 69 per cent of the total number of languages and nations, nationalities and peoples in the country are found in this Region.
This high percentile share of diversity necessitated the establishment of the institute in order to study the identity of the peoples of the region, with equal recognition and respect.
As a result, the Institute strives to foster unity and harmonious co-existence among people as well as contribute to the overall development and building of a generation that is proud of its identity.
One of the cardinal principles, which govern the over-all functioning of the institute, is strong belief in the equality of all the nationalities or non-partisanship.
The Institute comprises three departments: Culture Study Department, Language Study Department, and History and Heritage Study.
Since its establishment in October 2006, the Institute has produced documentary films on 11 nationalities.
The Institute has also collected different research works on the cultural and social values of the nationalities in the region from different domestic institutions.
Moreover the Institution has a plan to build and organize a regional cultural centre.
More than five museums and about ten associations have been established to protect and preserve traditional and natural resources found in the region, an excellent effort of the regional government.
The Ministry of Information and Regional Bureaus of Information are among the institutions that play major roles in the promotion of culture and traditions and thereby strengthening the culture of tolerance.
Under the Ministry of Information, the national theater exerts efforts towards promoting performing arts that promote the culture of different nation, nationalities, and peoples in the country.
Strategies for the implementation of the national cultural policy have been set.
Accordingly, the government has the duty to support on the basis of equality, the growth and enrichment of cultures and traditions that are compatible with fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.
The duty includes the establishment of museums, theaters, cinema halls, galleries institution of language studies and other institutions to promote the cultural policy.
The right of every nation, nationality and people in Ethiopia to use and develop its own language is guaranteed in the Constitution.
To this end, the national cultural policy aims at achieving the following objectives regarding language:
(a) To enable language and other cultural features of the various Nations, Nationalities and Peoples of Ethiopia receive equal recognition and respect to preserve, conserve them over to future generation;
(b) To create conducive conditions to carry out scientific research on language and other cultural features to ensure their role in development.
The policy sets detailed strategies and mechanisms for implementation of the plans contained in it.
Among other things, it asserts that enabling environment should be created for the preparation of dictionaries, encyclopedia and grammar texts in the languages of the various nations and nationalities.
Moreover, university programmes in various languages such as Afan Oromo and Tigrigna have been designed and implemented.
Information
The strategies for implementing the cultural policy require that educational programmes reflecting the various cultures of the country be broadcast by the mass media in order to promote the awareness of people regarding culture.
Dissemination of information regarding the diverse cultures found in the country play a paramount role in combating prejudice and promotes tolerance among people.
Government media has been primarily responsible in disseminating such information.
Government broadcasting agencies, including the Ethiopian television and Ethiopia Radio, which cover wide area of dissemination, air specific programmes that aim at combating prejudice and promoting tolerance and understanding among peoples.
Programmes intended to abolish deeply rooted harmful practices and backward attitudes that create prejudice have been transmitted.
These organs also allocate air time to individuals and organizations who work towards the same end.
State owned media, including the press disseminate through programmes that promote the culture, custom, language, historical and natural legacies of different nationalities.
Such programmes assess the multiple cultures and traditions found in different parts of the country and show the unique features of a specific culture.
The Ethiopian Television Agency in cooperation with Walta Information Center (privately owned media station) broadcasts such documentary films weekly on the national television.
The mass information media especially the press promotes human rights by publishing articles on human rights upon its own initiative or by a request from governmental and non -governmental organizations.
Different newsletters publish extracts from international human right instruments.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against Women have received wide coverage in discussing specific issues on children and women's rights.
Mass information media channels are important tools for NGO's working in the field of human rights in the country.
Government organs publish magazines on issues relevant to their mandate.
The House of Federation, the House of Peoples Representatives, the Ministry of Justice, the Federal Police Commission and the Federal Supreme Court publish periodic magazines.
These magazines feature issues on human rights.
The House of Federation has the duty to ensure that government mass media work to enhance the democratic culture of the people and raise their awareness about the Constitution.
The national human rights institutions also use the government media to promote human rights.
Accordingly, the curriculum for the training institution is designed with a view to achieving the objectives mentioned above.
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission and the Institution of the Ombudsman have given training to media professionals and reporters regarding their role in the promotion of human rights.
The principles of equality and non-discrimination are part of this training package.
The Broadcasting Service Program and Method of Functioning Directive also explicitly prohibit the use of language which undermines the culture of any section of the society.
Both the press law and broadcasting proclamation contains monitoring provisions that guide the use of language by the mass media.
In principle every transmitted programme must reflect varying points of view and serve the public at large through balanced presentation.
Broadcasting service licensees have the duty to make sure that the programmes they transmit are impartial, accurate and balanced.
Moreover, any programme intended for transmission should not violate the dignity and personal liberty of mankind or maliciously accuse or defame individuals, nation/nationalities, peoples or organizations.
Accordingly the use of language which could have the effect of causing any of the above-mentioned consequences is prohibited.
Moreover, there exists a code of conduct for reporters in every media organization.
Reporters have a duty, inter alia, not to discriminate in providing reports, on the basis of political opinion, religion, physical appearance, ethnicity, clan, sex or any other similar grounds.
A reporter who violates the code will be liable and the report he/she provides will be rejected.
Moreover, any report will lose its acceptability if it in any way scorns the religion or custom of a group or uses a language that denotes such attitude.
Campaigns that took place regarding the Manjo nationality is one of such instances.
Be with us.” The closing ceremony of the campaign was held on 10 December 2007 in Hawassa, the regional capital of the SNNPRS.
A panel discussion regarding the right of minority groups and a street march by the public were conducted.
Both the federal and state governments prepare different culture and language research symposiums, exhibitions and artistic festivals in their respective jurisdictions.
These programmes are used to bring together different nationalities to share their cultural values and experiences.

Introduction of draft decisions
In his absence, Ms. Leśnodorska (Poland), a Vice-President of the Board, would report on the consultations.
Ms. Leśnodorska (Poland) said that 15 draft decisions had been discussed in the informal consultations.
The discussions on agenda item 17 had proved somewhat difficult.
It had not been possible to reach a consensus on the draft decision tabled by the Permanent Mission of India.
A number of delegations had stated that they were not in a position to express their views on the draft decision without further consultations with their authorities.
A brief procedural President's proposal (IDB.36/L.16) had therefore been prepared for consideration by the Board.
However, India had reserved its position thereon at the level of the information consultations.
The names of a member and alternate members of the Staff Pension Committee would need to be added to the draft decision on personnel matters under agenda item 12 (IDB.36/L.8).
Regional groups had been invited to submit candidatures to the Secretariat before the General Conference session.
She thanked all delegates who had taken part in the consultations for their cooperation.
It had nevertheless asked for feedback during the consultations and was willing to accommodate any concerns of which it had been unaware.
Instead of a substantive response, however, it had merely heard procedural doubts and reservations based on the lack of time.
That was not a tenable position in the context of international diplomacy, especially since the topic had already been discussed in the Programme and Budget Committee.
He hoped that it did not reflect a hidden agenda, which would be incompatible with the spirit prevailing in the Board and in UNIDO.
India had stated its views in a straightforward manner and expected the same from others.
His delegation would abide unreservedly by the President's ruling.
The President invited the Legal Adviser to respond to the query.
Mr. Moradi (Legal Adviser) said that, if two draft decisions were submitted, one by India and one by the President, two separate decisions would have to be taken.
The President said that he would submit the draft decisions approved by consensus in the consultations as draft decisions of the President for consideration by the Board.

Rule 49, paragraph 1, of the rules of procedure required the Board to make every effort to ensure that all its substantive decisions were taken by consensus.
He understood that there had been no consensus on the Indian draft decision during the informal consultations.
He therefore asked the representative of India whether he could go along with the general consensus in a spirit of compromise.
Draft decision IDB.36/L.16 was adopted.
Adoption of the report (IDB.36/L.1)
Mr. Covarrubias (Plurinational State of Bolivia), Rapporteur, introducing document IDB.36/L.1, said that the draft report was incomplete owing to time constraints.
The final version, which would reflect all the proceedings, including the decisions adopted, would be compiled in close consultation with the Friends of the Rapporteur.
It was so decided.
Closure of the session
Mr. Yumkella (Director-General) warmly thanked all delegates, the chairpersons of the informal consultations and the Bureau for their diligence and dedication.
He was pleased to note that the Vienna spirit always prevailed in the end.
Their meaningful contributions and flexibility had brought about the consensus reflected in the decisions adopted.
Industrialization was a prerequisite for rapid economic growth, wealth creation and the enhancement of standards of living.
Its potential for job creation and its inextricable link to the optimum utilization of the service sector were unquestionable.
Member States and the international community must therefore remain committed to UNIDO's ideals and provide it with the tools and prescriptions it required for the attainment of those objectives.

The Colombian State wishes to engage into a constructive relation with HR Defenders, which does not exclude open and honest debate on differences of opinion.
(A) Prevention of violence and maintenance of public order
Colombia will continue to make efforts to protect the general public from these bands.
It appeals for international support in combating the drug trafficking which supports their existence and ensuring that the logistics, money and individuals involved in the violence have nowhere to go.
Giving the Office of the Public Procurator a greater role in disciplinary investigations of police and army personnel.
Expanding the Victim and Witness Protection Programme.
Getting the regional property restitution committees into operation.
(C) Discrimination and vulnerable population groups
Strengthening the indigenous and Afro-Colombian authorities.

Applying reparation policy to the displaced population.
The above notwithstanding, Colombia acknowledges major challenges in seeking to restrain displays of violence against women.
Strengthen semi-official investigation in the event of sexual and domestic violence.
Guarantee female victims of such violence full access to justice.
Guarantee a safe setting and favourable environment for the exercise by women of their Rights.
Safeguard the rights of women affected by violence by armed outlaw bands.
Apply the gender perspective to victim care policies and make public servants aware of that perspective.
The challenges facing the State are:
To give full effect to the new Code in all areas.
To provide backing for the Social Protection System to safeguard boys' rights.
To bolster policies on comprehensive social and family protection so as to prevent Recruitment.
To bring child labour indices down to 5.1 per cent by 2015.
The subject of special protection for same-sex couples has appeared on the public agenda in Colombia, and has led to important developments in jurisprudence.
The Constitutional Court has on various occasions upheld the right of same-sex couples to equality.
Colombia now faces the challenge of continuing to advance in this area.

Sixty-third session
Agenda item 133
Financing of the United Nations Operation in Burundi
Final disposition of assets of the United Nations Operation in Burundi
Report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions
Introduction
The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) (A/63/551).
The mandate of ONUB was established by the Security Council in its resolution 1545 (2004) and was last extended, until 31 December 2006, by the Council in its resolution 1692 (2006).
In his report, the report of the Secretary-General provided information on the final disposition of the assets of ONUB, with a total inventory value of $59,152,442, as at 3 November 2008.
The Secretary-General indicated that the process of liquidating the assets of ONUB was guided by the principles and policies contained in United Nations financial regulation 5.14.
The assets have been categorized into three groups (see A/63/551, table 1).
Upon request, the Committee was provided with information on the 20 missions that had received assets transferred from ONUB, including the quantity, value and percentage of assets for each receiving mission (see annex).
Upon enquiry as to why the transferred assets were not reflected in the proposed budgets of receiving missions, the Advisory Committee was informed that the timing of liquidation and budget preparation activities rendered this difficult.
However, transferred assets are reflected in the inventory of a receiving mission, and substantial changes in funding requirements are reflected in the performance reports.
Group II includes assets disposed of locally with an inventory value of $4,735,622 (8 per cent).
The proceeds of the sale, in the amount of $567,730, were credited to the Special Account for ONUB as miscellaneous income, as reflected in table 2 of the report of the Secretary-General.
10 and table 3).
Conclusion
The action to be taken by the General Assembly in connection with the financing of the United Nations Operation in Burundi is contained in paragraph 11 of the report of the Secretary-General.
The Advisory Committee recommends that the Assembly take note of the report.
